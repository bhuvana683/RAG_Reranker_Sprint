# Industrial Safety Mini-RAG Q&A

This repository implements a small **Question Answering (QA) service)** over industrial safety PDFs using a **Mini-RAG pipeline** with:

- **Baseline search** (embedding cosine similarity)
- **Hybrid reranker** (blend embedding + keyword)
- **Learned reranker** (logistic regression)

Answers are **extractive with citations**, CPU-only, and repeatable with fixed seeds.

---

## **Setup**

1. Clone repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/industrial-safety-qa.git
cd industrial-safety-qa
````

2. Create virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # Windows PowerShell
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Prepare data:

* Extract `industrial-safety-pdfs.zip` into `data/industrial-safety-pdfs/`
* Ensure `sources.json` exists with PDF â†’ URL/title mapping
* Run `scripts/ingest_chunks.py` to populate `chunks.db`
* Run `scripts/build_index.py` to generate `faiss_index.bin` and `metadata.json`

## **Learnings**

1. **Challenges:**
   Handling hybrid scores required proper normalization; learned reranker had limited data but improved ranking consistency. Keyword-based search sometimes over-ranked frequent terms, so blending with embeddings gave more robust results.

2. **Observations:**

   * Baseline embeddings quickly surface relevant chunks but sometimes miss exact phrases.
   * Hybrid reranker balances semantic similarity with lexical match.
   * Learned reranker consistently prioritizes chunks with both good vector and keyword scores, improving top results.

## **Example curl Requests**

**Easy question:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"q":"What are PPE safety requirements?", "k":5, "mode":"baseline"}'
```

**Tricky question:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"q":"When should emergency stop be applied?", "k":5, "mode":"learned"}'
```

## **Notes**

* All processing is CPU-only.
* Answers are **extractive** with citations.
* Outputs are repeatable via fixed random seeds.
* API abstains if confidence < 0.1.
