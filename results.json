Avoid the risk already at the design stage. (For example, reduce power, avoid interference in the danger zone.) 2. Use protection and/or safety devices. (For example, fences, light grids or control devices.) 3. Provide information about how the machine can be used safely. (For example, in manuals and on signs.)

As an alternative to active protective field switching, it is possible to sep‐ arately evaluate simultaneous protective fields. Safety laser scanners with vertical (or slightly tilted) protective fields are generally used for this application. The appropriate protective field, from a series of pre‐ programmed protective fields, is activated by corre‐ sponding signals from the machine controller and ade‐ quately positioned sensors. The contour of the protec‐ tive field is designed such that passage of the material does not cause the protective device to activate, but unmonitored areas are small enough to prevent unde‐ tected entry into the hazardous area by anyone ( see figure 61).

These signals from the OSSDs are used to stop the dangerous machine functions. A safety laser scanner is an optical sensor which monitors a hazardous area on a machine or vehicle by scanning the area around it on a single plane with infrared light beams. The safety laser scanner operates on the principle of optic al time-of-flight measurement. The scanner sends very short light pulses (S) while an “electronic stop‐ watch” runs simultaneously. If the light strikes an object, it is reflected and received by the scanner (R). The scanner calculates the distance from the object from the difference between the send and receive times.

Machine safety is one of the most rapidly growing areas of importance in industrial automation. PART 1 – THEORY AND BACKGROUND7 — Safety and functional safety The purpose of safety is to protect people and the environment from accidents and risks caused by machines. Functional safety systems do this by lowering the probability of undesired events, so that mishaps are minimized when operating machinery. Safety standards define safety as freedom from unacceptable risk. Acceptable risk levels are defined by means of required risk reduction in the machinery safety standards. Machine builders should always use the same (the most stringent) acceptability criteria for all market areas, regardless of regional differences. The most effective way to eliminate risks is to design machines to be inherently safe. But if risk reduction by design is not possible or practical, safeguarding through static guards or safety functions is often the best option. Machine safety functions can be used to reduce the risks caused by movement while maintainingmachine productivity, uptime and usability.

These must be designed and selected so that the probability of functional errors is sufficiently low. If this is not possible, any faults that occur must not lead to the loss of the safety function. In addition to the safeguards of the machine designer, the machine operator or user may require additional protective measures for reducing the residual risk (e.g. personal protective equipment, training etc.).Functional safety During its entire life cycle – from manufacture to disassembling – a machine poses danger to man, machine and the environment. It is therefore necessary to identify these dangers already when the machine is designed and reduce them by means of suitable measures. The EU Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC stipulates that a machine should not pose any danger. However, as there is no 100% safety in engineering, the aim is to reduce these dangers to a tolerable level of residual risk by means of risk reduction measures. The overall safety of a machine defines the state in which it can be considered as being free of unwarranted risks to persons or as free of danger. The functional safety is part of the overall safety of a system which depends on the correct functioning of the safety- related systems, other technology, safety-related systems and external risk reduction facilities.

However, as there is no 100% safety in engineering, the aim is to reduce these dangers to a tolerable level of residual risk by means of risk reduction measures. The overall safety of a machine defines the state in which it can be considered as being free of unwarranted risks to persons or as free of danger. The functional safety is part of the overall safety of a system which depends on the correct functioning of the safety- related systems, other technology, safety-related systems and external risk reduction facilities. Reducing the risk of a machine The international standard EN ISO 12100 “Safety of machinery – Basic concepts, general principles for design” provides the design engineer with detailed assistance in the identification of hazards",

Finally the report describes a number of differe nt methods to determine the overall PL for the safety functions. 67 Appendix A Safety requirements specification – machinery This appendix presents a template for the safety requirements specification for safety functions intended for machinery applications. A safety function has the following definition: a function of the machine whose failure can result in an immediate increase of the risk (s). Parts of machinery control systems that are assigned to provide safety functions are called safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS). The standard does not give support or requirements on the content of a safety requirements specification for the design of safety functions. Requirements are instead focused on the software safety requirements , the specification of safety functions and details of safety functions. All relevant information for the required f unctionality of the safety functions shall be described and it is important that requirements are described in a way to avoid misunderstandings. The safety requirement s specification is an important document during verification and validation activities. In some cases, the information regarding the machinery may not be possible to get before the design process of the machine is starte d. In this case the safety requirements specification needs to be updated during the design process. The result of the risk analysis for the machin ery is the base for the requirements as well as the intended use for the machinery and e xpected environmental aspects for the machinery. The following is an example of what is needed: • Functional description of the machinery • The work modes of the machinery • The identified safety functions • Functional description of the safety functions • Cycle time of the machinery • Response time of the machinery • Environmental conditions • Interactions",

Simply put, it is a measure taken to reduce the likelihood of an unwanted event occurring and exposing a hazard. A safety function is not part of machine operation: if such a function fails, the machine can still operate normally, but the risk of injury from its operation increases. Defining a safety function is a key issue. This always includes two components: –Action (what must be done to reduce the risk). –Safety performance (SIL or PL – Safety Integrity Level and Performance Level respectively). Example of a safety function: Hazard: An exposed rotating shaft may cause injury if a person gets too close. Action: To prevent personal injury, the motor must stop within one (1) second from opening the safety gate. After the safety function that executes the action has been identified, its required safety level is determined as described below. This completes defining the safety function. Safety performance/integrity Safety integrity measures the performance of a safety function. It helps quantify the likelihood of the safety function being achieved when requested.

In order for issues not covered by a product standard to be identified, the first two steps in the risk reduction strategy described below must always be performed, i.e. the limits of the machinery must be defined and the hazards iden - tified. 5.2 Risk reduction strategy The risk reduction strategy presented in EN ISO 12100 [3] was adopted in Figure 1 of EN ISO 13849-1 and supple - mented with the aspects detailed in the latter standard (see Figure 5.1). A risk assessment is first performed. An important point is the assumption during the following steps that no protective measures have as yet been taken on the machine. Ultimately, the entire risk reduction pro - cess serves to determine the type and also the “quality” of the protective measure/safeguard that is to be imple - mented. The risk reduction process begins with definition of the limits of the machine. Besides the space limits and time limits of the machine, attention must be paid in particular to its use limits. Such limits include the intended use of the machine (e.g. materials which may permissibly be machined on it), including all operating modes and the various intervention procedures. Reasonably foreseeable misuse of the machine must also be considered; this includes consideration for the defeating of safeguards. 1 Safety-related parts of control systems are one means by which a safety function is implemented. The starting-point for these systems is the reception of safety-related input signals, for example detection of the position of a guard door by means of a Type 2 position switch, the separate actuator of which is fitted to the door and itself constitutes a safety-related part. Once received, the signals are",

Simply put, it is a measure taken to reduce the likelihood of an unwanted event occurring and exposing a hazard. A safety function is not part of machine operation: if such a function fails, the machine can still operate normally, but the risk of injury from its operation increases. Defining a safety function is a key issue. This always includes two components: –Action (what must be done to reduce the risk). –Safety performance (SIL or PL – Safety Integrity Level and Performance Level respectively). Example of a safety function: Hazard: An exposed rotating shaft may cause injury if a person gets too close. Action: To prevent personal injury, the motor must stop within one (1) second from opening the safety gate. After the safety function that executes the action has been identified, its required safety level is determined as described below. This completes defining the safety function. Safety performance/integrity Safety integrity measures the performance of a safety function. It helps quantify the likelihood of the safety function being achieved when requested. The required safety integrity for a function is",

A risk assessment is a sequence of logical steps that facilitate the systematic analysis and evaluation of risks. The results of the risk assessment must be taken into account when designing and constructing the machine (risk reduction). The risk assessment should help to reduce or avoid risks. As a consequence it may identify necessary measures to protect the operator from hazards. If necessary, the risk assessment process must be repeated several times. The first process steps are intended to identify and assess hazards. This is followed by an evaluation and, if necessary, risk mitigation. If the measure triggers a new hazard, the repeated risk assessment reveals this. Being machine-related and application-specific, the risk assessment is already specified in many type-C standards. If this is not the case or not applicable, the requirements of the type-A and type-B standards can be used.

In its third, 2015 edition, EN ISO 13849-1 is the successor standard to EN 954-1:1996 [9], and is already listed in the Official Journal of the EU. The presumption of conformity to which the 2008 version gave rise expired on 30 June 2016. The three-year transitional period in which EN 954-1 remained valid in parallel has long expired; users may therefore use this standard, if at all, only by making dated reference to individual subclauses of it. Part 2 of EN ISO 13849-2 [6] was published in 2012 following revi - sion. The purpose of the present revised IFA Report is to describe the application of EN ISO 13849 and in particular its practical implementation with reference to numerous model solutions. Particular attention has been attached to the presentation and interpretation of the new or revised requirements set out in the third edition of EN ISO 13849-1. Neither the explanations nor the examples should be regarded as an official national or European comment upon (DIN) EN ISO 13849-1. Rather, the report is a compilation of thirty-five years‘ experience gained at the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the Ger - man Social Accident Insurance (IFA) in the assessment of safety and control equipment employing various forms of technology, and the institute‘s many years of participation on relevant national and international standards commit - tees.

They are intended to provide users with an option to choose the one most suitable for their situation. A user can choose to use either standard and they are both harmonized under the European Machinery Directive.The outputs of both standards provide comparable levels of safety performance or integrity. The methodologies of each standard have differences that are appropriate for their intended users.The methodology in IEC/EN 62061 is intended to allow for complex safety functionality which may be implemented by previously unconventional system architectures. The methodology of (EN) ISO 13849-1 is intended to provide a more direct and less complicated route for more conventional safety functionality implemented by conventional system architectures. An important distinction between these two standards is the applicability to various technologies. IEC/EN 62061 is better suited to electrical systems.

The examples in this document are simplified in order to provide an understanding of the principles. The values used in the examples can change. What is PL (Performance Level)? PL is a measure of the reliability of a safety function. PL is divided into five levels (a-e). PL e gives the best reliability and is equivalent to that required at the highest level of risk. To calculate which level the PL system achieves you need to know the following: • The system’s structure (categories B, 1-4) • The Mean Time To dangerous Failure of the component (MTTFd) • The system’s Diagnostic Coverage (DC) You will also need to: • protect the system against a failure that knocks out both channels (CCF) • protect the system from systematic errors built into the design • follow certain rules to ensure software can be developed and validated in the right way The five PL -levels (a-e) correspond to certain ranges of PFHD- values (probability of dangerous failure per hour). These indicate how likely it is that a dangerous failure could occur over a period of one hour. In the calculation, it is beneficial to use PFHD-values directly as the PL is a simplification that does not provide equally accurate results.

We notice that most of our customers prefer PL as it is technology-neutral and that they can use their previous knowledge in the categories. In this document we show some examples of how to build safety solutions in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1 and calculate the reliability of the safety functions to be used for a particular machine. The examples in this document are simplified in order to provide an understanding of the principles. The values used in the examples can change. What is PL (Performance Level)? PL is a measure of the reliability of a safety function. PL is divided into five levels (a-e). PL e gives the best reliability and is equivalent to that required at the highest level of risk. To calculate which level the PL system achieves you need to know the following: • The system’s structure (categories B, 1-4) • The Mean Time To dangerous Failure of the component (MTTFd) • The system’s Diagnostic Coverage (DC) You will also need to: • protect the system against a failure that knocks out both channels (CCF) • protect the system from systematic errors built into the design • follow certain rules to ensure software can be developed and validated in the right way The five PL -levels (a-e) correspond to certain ranges of PFHD- values (probability of dangerous failure per hour). These indicate how likely it is that a dangerous failure could occur over a period of one hour. In the calculation, it is beneficial to use PFHD-values directly as the PL is a simplification that does not provide equally accurate results. What is the easiest way of complying with the standard? 1. Use pre-calculated",

Summary: Risk assessment General • Per form a risk assessment for all hazards. This iterative process must take into account all hazards and risks until there are no residual risks or only acceptable residual risks remain. Risk assessment process • St art the risk assessment by establishing the functions and the limits of the machine. • During the risk assessment, take into account in particular reasonably foreseeable misuse and malfunctions. • Then identify the hazards (mechanical, electrical, thermal,etc.) derived from the operation of the machine. Take into account these hazards in all life phases of the machine. • Then estimate the risks derived from the hazards. These depend on the extent of harm and the probability of occurrence of the harm. • Document the results of your risk assessment.1 – RISK ASSESSMENT 28 S P E C I A L I N F O R M A T I O N | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice Risk reduction strategy If the risk assessment shows that measures are required to reduce the risk, the 3-step method shall be used.

Emergency-stop operation The Emergency-stop function is activated by a single manual operation of a person. It must always be available and functional ( ➔ EN ISO 13849-1). The particular operating mode is not important. Design the Emergency-stop devices in such a way that the user is not forced to consider the consequences of operating the device. This prevents delays up to the point of activating the device when the system is disconnected. The efficiency of safety devices and devices with safety-related functions must not be impaired by the Emergency-stop function. This also includes the rescue of persons from hazardous situations.

With regard to the control technology issues addressed in this report, these complementary protective measures parti - cularly include:• Measures for stopping in an emergency • Reversal of movements • Isolation and energy dissipation According to the definition, these do not constitute tech - nical protective measures the implementation of which would require a certain Performance Level. These com - plementary protective measures should however take effect when technical protective measures (guards and/ or protective devices) have failed or have been defeated. In these cases in particular, an emergency stop function for example is expected actually to be serviceable. The requirements placed by IEC 60204-1 [25] upon control circuits and the control functions of machines should therefore be observed. subclause 9.4, “Control functions in the event of failure”, requires an appropriate level of safety performance, which must be defined by the risk evaluation of the machine. Ultimately, the requirements of EN ISO 13849 therefore also apply to these comple - mentary protective measures. Under no circumstances may complementary protective measures influence the function and standard of safeguards. 5.6 Treatment of legacy machinery Legacy machinery in this context refers to machines that were placed on the market before the Machinery Directive came into force. The requirements of the directive were not applied to these machines. However, its application may become necessary should legacy machines be exten - ded, modified, modernized, etc. In such cases, it must be assessed whether an essential change has occurred. Should this be the case, the requirements of the EC Machinery Directive apply to “old”, i.e. legacy machines in the same way as to new machinery. These requirements include the application of EN ISO 13849. An interpretation",
