(2) The machinery sector is an important part of the engineering industry and is one of the industrial mainstays of the Union economy. The social cost of the large number of accidents caused directly by the use of machinery can be reduced by inherently safe design and construction of machinery and by proper installation and maintenance. (3) Experience with the application of Directive 2006/42/EC has shown inadequacies and inconsistencies in the product coverage and conformity assessment procedures. It is therefore necessary to improve, simplify and adapt the provisions set out in that Directive to the needs of the market and provide clear rules in relation to the framework within which products within the scope of this Regulation may be made available on the market.

(11) Where there is a possibility that machinery or related products will be used by a consumer, that is to say, a non- professional user, the manufacturer should take account of the fact that the consumer does not have the same knowledge of and experience in handling machinery or related products in the design and construction of the products. The same applies where the machinery or related product is normally used to provide a service to a consumer. (12) Recently, more advanced machinery, which is less dependent on human operators, has been introduced on the market. Such machinery is working on defined tasks and in structured environments, yet it can learn to perform new actions in this context and become more autonomous. Further refinements to machinery, already in place or to be expected, include real-time processing of information, problem solving, mobility, sensor systems, learning, adaptability, and capability of operating in unstructured environments (for example construction sites). The Commission Report on the safety and liability implications of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things and Robotics of 19 February 2020, states that the emergence of new digital technologies, like artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and robotics, raises new challenges in terms of product safety. The report concludes that the current product safety legislation, including Directive 2006/42/EC, contains a number of gaps in this respect that need to be addressed. Thus,",

(58) In order to enable economic operators to demonstrate and the competent authorities to ensure that machinery or related products made available on the market are in conformity with the essential health and safety require ­ ments, it is necessary to provide for conformity assessment procedures. Decision No 768/2008/EC establishes modules for conformity assessment procedures, which include procedures from the least to the most stringent, in proportion to the level of risk involved and the level of safety required. In order to ensure inter-sectoral coherence and to avoid ad hoc variants, conformity assessment procedures should be chosen from among those modules. (59) Manufacturers should be responsible for ensuring that a conformity assessment is carried out in respect of their machinery or related products in accordance with this Regulation. Nevertheless, for certain categories of machinery or related products that have a higher risk factor, a stricter conformity assessment procedure requiring the participation of a notified body should be required. (60) It is essential that all notified bodies perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition. That requires the setting of obligatory requirements for conformity assessment bodies wishing to be notified in order to provide conformity assessment services.

(62) In order to ensure a consistent level of quality in the performance of conformity assessment of machinery or related products, it is also necessary to set requirements for notifying authorities and other bodies involved in the assessment, notification and monitoring of notified bodies. (63) The system set out in this Regulation should be complemented by the accreditation system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Since accreditation is an essential means of verifying the competence of conformity assessment bodies, it should also be used for the purposes of notification. (64) Transparent accreditation as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, ensuring the necessary level of confidence in certificates of conformity, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of conformity assessment bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means of carrying out that evaluation themselves. In such cases, in order to ensure the appropriate level of credibility of evaluations carried out by other national authorities, they should provide the Commission and the other Member States with the necessary documentary evidence demonstrating the compliance of the conformity assessment bodies evaluated with the relevant regulatory requirements. (65) Conformity assessment bodies frequently subcontract parts of their activities linked to the assessment of conformity or have recourse to a subsidiary. In order to safeguard the level of protection required for the machinery or related products to be placed on the market, it is essential that conformity assessment subcon ­ tractors and subsidiaries fulfil the same requirements as notified bodies in relation to the performance of conformity assessment tasks.

(66) Since notified bodies may offer their services throughout the Union, it is appropriate to give the other Member States and the Commission the opportunity to raise objections concerning a notified body. It is therefore important to provide for a period during which any doubts or concerns as to the competence of conformity assessment bodies can be clarified before they start operating as notified bodies. (67) In the interests of competitiveness, it is crucial that notified bodies apply the conformity assessment procedures without creating unnecessary burdens for economic operators. For the same reason, and to ensure equal treatment of economic operators, consistency in the technical application of the conformity assessment procedures needs to be ensured. That can best be achieved through appropriate coordination and cooperation between notified bodies. (68) Market surveillance is an essential instrument to ensure the proper and uniform application of Union law. It is therefore appropriate to put in place a legal framework within which market surveillance can be carried out in an appropriate manner with regard to products within the scope of this Regulation. (69) Member States should take all appropriate measures to ensure that machinery and related products may be placed on the market or put into service only if, where properly installed and maintained and used for its intended purpose, or under conditions of use which can be reasonably foreseen, they do not endanger the health or safety of persons, in particular consumers and professional users, and, where appropriate, of domestic animals and property, and, where applicable, the environment.

These must be designed and selected so that the probability of functional errors is sufficiently low. If this is not possible, any faults that occur must not lead to the loss of the safety function. In addition to the safeguards of the machine designer, the machine operator or user may require additional protective measures for reducing the residual risk (e.g. personal protective equipment, training etc.).Functional safety During its entire life cycle – from manufacture to disassembling – a machine poses danger to man, machine and the environment. It is therefore necessary to identify these dangers already when the machine is designed and reduce them by means of suitable measures. The EU Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC stipulates that a machine should not pose any danger. However, as there is no 100% safety in engineering, the aim is to reduce these dangers to a tolerable level of residual risk by means of risk reduction measures. The overall safety of a machine defines the state in which it can be considered as being free of unwarranted risks to persons or as free of danger. The functional safety is part of the overall safety of a system which depends on the correct functioning of the safety- related systems, other technology, safety-related systems and external risk reduction facilities. Reducing the risk of a machine The international standard EN ISO 12100 “Safety of machinery – Basic concepts, general principles for design” provides the design engineer with detailed assistance in the identification of hazards",

The five PLs (a, b, c, d, e) stand for average probability values of a dangerous failure per hour. The final validation of all protective measures, ensuring the reliable operation of the desired safety functions is part of EN ISO 13849-2. EN IEC 62061 “Safety of machinery – functional safety of safety- related electrical and electronic and programmable electronic control systems” Within the general scope of EN ISO 12100, the EN IEC 62061 standard is an alternative standard to EN ISO 13849-1. The safety-related performance is described by the three SIL Safety Integrity Levels (1, 2, 3).

    "text": "2Emergency-stop devices Emergency-stop devices must ensure positive opening operation. In emergency-stop actuators with positive opening contacts → as per IEC/EN 60 947-5-1, Appendix K, the contacts are opened by means of a rigid link between the actuator and the contact set. Furthermore, these devices also need to be tamper-proof. Emergency-stop contact monitoring with SMC (self-monitoring contact) in the event of special hazards that may affect the functioning of the actuator: The SMC system consists of an N/C contact element connected in series with an N/O contact element. The dual-channel solution consists of two N/C contact elements. In this case, the series connection also consists of an N/C and an N/O contact element. The N/O contact of the SMC is connected to the actuator in such a way that it will only close when a correct connection between actuator and contact element has been established. In the event of an incorrectly plugged in or torn-off contact element block, or if the cover of the surface-mounted enclosure is torn off, the N/O contact will only open (and thereby trigger the safety function) if an SMC is installed. Safety assessment: The RMQ dual-channel emergency-stop devices without SMC have a B10d value of 2,000,000. This makes it possible to implement safety configurations up to SIL3 / PL e. Example: If, for example, fewer than 660,000 operations are performed each year, which will always be the case with emergency-stop devices, a high MTTFd value is achieved. Through appropriate measures in the connected decision logic, a high DC value can also be achieved. If the configuration also conforms to cat. 4, all the requirements for SIL3 / PLe will be met. When to use an SMC: If a particular hazard is identified during the risk analysis or validation of an emergency-stop button, additional fault-detection measures may",

In such cases, stricter safety requirements apply, which operators must take into account. In the event of such special hazards, an SMC is used in order to reduce the risk level, as required. 15 12/22 PU05907001Z-EN Introduction Safety contactors All versions of the DILMS safety contactor are equipped with a top- mounted auxiliary contact that is non-detachable. This auxiliary contact integrates mirror contacts as well as positive-opening contacts. A built-in inspection window situated directly above the switch-position indicator clearly indicates the current status of the machine or system This prevents the manual actuation of the safety contactor. The DILMS range of safety contactors is available in four different sizes, which cover the current range from 7 A to 150 A. The product range also includes the DILAS safety relay. The devices cover the following drive types: • 110V 50Hz, 120V 60Hz • 230V 50Hz, 240V 60Hz • 24VDC (RDC24) The safety contactors are CE, UL, CSA and SUVA certified. Overview: • Safe status monitoring (inspection window) – manual actuation is not possible • Emergency-stop function with controlled start (category 4) • Positive-opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1 • Mirror contacts • RAL 1004 golden yellow • Top-mounted and non-detachable auxiliary contact (at the front)Safety parameters The same safety",

Other factors and interrelationships should also be taken into account. Weld-free design Open the circuit, “switch off” the hazard – this is not possible with welded contacts. If the switching device is for safety purposes, a risk evaluation may make overdimensioning or redundancy necessary (“Feedback Circuit”, page 106). Try to ensure that the protective device trips in the event of a short-circuit or overcurrent before the contacts of the switching devices weld. The protective device should naturally also be able to withstand the motor startup or the switching on of transfomers.Design the control circuit correctly A short-circuit in the control circuit can cause uncontrolled states. In the worst case this may cause the failure of the safety functions. This may either cause • contacts to weld or • the short-circuit current to cause the tripping of the short-circuit protective device. In both cases, the correct choice of short-circuit protective device and the transformer is critical. Section 7.2.10 in IEC 60204-1 stipulates that protective devices should be weld-free: “When selecting those protective devices, consideration shall be given to the protection of switching devices against damage due to overcurrents (for example welding of the switching device contacts). You should therefore choose the lowest value for the maximum permissible overcurrent protective device specified for the switching devices used. Ensure that the prospective short-circuit current in your control circuits does not exceed 1000 A. Switching devices in accordance with EN 60947- 5-1 are protected against welding up to this maximum value by means",

Carry out function tests The control system should carry out the function tests automatically in the best case. Many functions cannot be tested automatically. For example, an Emergency-stop actuator is only actuated in the event of an emergency. Carry out individual function tests at appropriate intervals. Arrange devices effectively Refer to the requirements of “ISO 14119”, page 118 concerning the arrangement of position switches. Use safety switching devices and programmable electronic safety control relays Safety switching devices are components of the protective equipment on machines and plants.

The decision whether to use a conventional or an electronically programmable safety device depends on the application at hand. A conventional safety switching device is an effective solution for simple applications. Contact expansion modules enable safety-related enabling paths to be reproduced cost effectively ( → figure 59, page 107). With complex tasks, an electronically programmable control relay can offer an extensive range of functions. The flexible programming allows you to implement different safety-related functions and safety categories. The entire machine or system control is normally implemented separately in a non-safety section with conventional PLC technology and a safety- related section with safety switching devices or control relays.11.3 Engineering machines",

The operator therefore goes to the danger zone and tries to rectify the fault. For this situation, the drive may possibly have to start in the opposite direction. If this is only possible by manually operating the contactors, there is a high risk of danger. The wrong drive may be started or the wrong rotation direction may be selected.

Hazard detected, hazard excluded A risk estimation must be made for the entire machine as well as for its associated parts. If the conclusion is reached that a circuit or component failure in protective devices may cause danger, then additional measures must be taken to avoid the risks in the event of a fault. This procedure must be executed carefully and documented in every case.

The fulfillment of safety objectives is meant to ensure protection from hazards caused by electrical current in low-voltage devices. Important basic requirements in the form of safety objectives are described in Annex I of the directive. Low-voltage devices include electrical switching devices, conductors, cables, wires and installation components with a voltage range of 50 – 1000 V AC and 120 – 1500 V DC (see EN 50110-1). EMC Directive The marking of products compliant with the EMC Directive 2004/108/EEC has been compulsory since 1996. The EMC Directive stipulates two basic requirements placed on the electromagnetic compatibility of devices: • IEC 61000-6-1 – Immunity, i.e. the appropriate immunity of devices to electromagnetic interference. • IEC 61000-6-3 – Emission, i.e. the highest value of electromagnetic interference emitted by devices (radiation, emission). Different requirements are placed on industrial applications on the one hand, and home, business, trade, light industry, small companies, offices and laboratories on the other. Machinery Directive Since the beginning of 1995 CE marking has been made obligatory for compliance with the Machinery Directive 89/392/EC.

In accordance with this directive, a machine means an “assembly of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves, with the appropriate actuators, control and power circuits etc., joined together for a specific application.” It also includes the actuating devices as well as the control and power circuits which are added for a particular application (such as the processing, treatment, moving or packaging of a material). However, the Machinery Directive only contains basic requirements whilst there are many different types of machines available.

Target group Machine designers B and C standards makers and creators of factory standards. Essential points in brief The strategy for risk reduction is specified as follows: Perform a risk assessment by carrying out the following steps in the order given: • Determine limits and intended use of the machine. • Identify possible hazards and hazardous situations. • Assess the risk for every hazard or hazardous situation. • Evaluate risk and make decisions on the necessity of risk reduction. If the result of the risk assessment shows that risk reduction is necessary, protective measures must be taken according to the following “3-step method”. 1. Inherently safe design Choose suitable design features as principal measures for hazard removal: • No sharp corners or edges. • Observe minimum clearances from hazards. • Reduce forces, speeds and weights to safe values. • Design parts within the load limits. • Use intrinsically safe technologies such as safety extra-low voltage, non-toxic fluids in the hydraulics etc. • Mechanical restraint devices shall be given preference over solutions dependent on",

Take into account all “phases of the working life” of the machine: Construction, transport and commissioning, operation and implementation, decommissioning, dismantling and, when necessary, disposal. 2. Risk reduction by means of technical safeguards Technical protection measures must be applied if it is not possible to reduce the potential hazards by means of appropriate design features. Example 1: If access to the danger zone is not necessary during operation, close this area off by means of mechanical covers. EN 953 describes the requirements placed on “ guards”. Example 2: Ensure the following measures if the user must work in the danger zone: • Movable guard with monitoring feature. • Electro-sensitive protective equipment. • Two-hand control. The guards should remain functional when possible during maintenance and setting operations. If this is not possible, a lockable operating mode selector switch must be used. This should enable an operating mode of “reduced risk” such as creep speed to be selected manually. 3.

For electromechanical components, the MTTFd value depends primarily on the number of actuations. EN ISO 13849-1 provides the following calculation equation for this purpose: MTTFd =B10 d 0.1 x n op B10 d nop: Mean number of annual operations. 1 =1 +1 +1 MTTFd =MTTF d, channel 1/2 MTTF d, Input MTTF d, Logic MTTF d, Output 208.3 [years]DC avg=DC Input +DC Logic +DC Output =0.99 1+1+1MTTF d, Input MTTF d, Logic MTTF d, Output MTTF d, Input MTTF d, Logic MTTF Output;: Mean number of operating cycles up to 10% of the components have failed dangerously. We will assume for our Emergency-stop safety function an operating frequency of 5 operations per day. The system is required to be in operation 360 days a year and two shifts per day, i.e. 16 hours per day. This results in an nop of 1800 operating cycles. The B10d value is specified by the component manufacturer. If no manufacturer specifications are available, Annex C EN ISO 13849-1 provides an overview with typical values as a substitute. Example In our example we will set a B10d value for the Emergency-stop device of 100000 cycles (manufacturer specification) a B10d value of 1.3·106 cycles (manufacturer specification). This results in the following values for the individual subsystems: • Input Unit: MTTFd, Input = 555.5 [years] • Logic Unit: MTTFd, Logic = 358",

Symmetrization is not necessary for our example, since the structure of both channels is the same. Result The mean time to dangerous failure with the Emergency-stop safety function is around 208 years. The maximum to be taken into account by the standard is 100 years, which corresponds to a level based on EN ISO 13849-1 table 5 of MTTFd =“high”.3.3 Determining the diagnostic coverage (DC) The safety integrity can be increased by the internal testing of the subsystems. The diagnostic coverage is a measure of fault detection efficiency. The DC can be determined for parts of the safety-related system or for the entire system. If a safety-related control system consists of several parts, an average value DCavg is used for determining the achieved performance level. In complex systems a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is necessary. For simple systems, the standard supplies a simplified approach for determining the DC (see EN ISO 13849-1, Annex E). Example For our example, this means in real terms that we take the appropriate DC for the input, logic and output",

In the overall framework of EN ISO 12100 it serves as an alternative to EN ISO 13849-1 for the specification of the required safety performance of safety-related electrical control systems for the reduction of risks. EN IEC 62061 is a sector specific standard beneath IEC 61508 and covers the entire life cycle of the machine (from the concept phase to dismantling) and describes the safety performance by means of the so- called safety integrity level (SIL). The latest edition of EN EN IEC 62601 can now also be applied to non- electrical (e.g. hydraulic, pneumatic) safety-related control elements of machines. The safety integrity requirements of a safety-related electrical control system (SRECS) are determined from the risk analysis. The basic principle for risk reduction is achieved by means of an iterative process like EN ISO 13849-1.

The subsystem can consist of one or several subsystem elements. The EN IEC 62061 standard defines a subsystem element as the part of a subsystem, which comprises an individual or a group of components. The standard provides 4 different subsystem architectures (A,B,C,D) that offer different hardware fault tolerances (HFT) and the diagnostic functions provided. Appropriate calculation equations for each of these architectures are specified in the EN IEC 62061 standard. • Basic subsystem architecture A: Zero fault tolerance, without diagnostic function Each failure of a subsystem element causes a failure of the SRCF.

A diagnostic function is not provided.• Basic subsystem architecture B: Single fault tolerance, without diagnostic function A single fault of a subsystem element does not cause the loss of safety function.

C= Switching frequency of the application per hour. B10 = Number of operations, up to 10 % of the electromechanical devices tested that have failed (manufacturers' specifications). λd=λ x Rate of dangerous failures λd=Dangerous failure rate per hour. →The ratio of dangerous failures is stated in this manual in the chapters 1…6 as a ratio of λd/λ. The parameter C represents the operating cycles specified for the application. If the B10 value is not specified by the manufacturer, an overview of typical failure rates for electrical components can be found in standard EN ISO 13849-1, Annex C.1. B10 values can be calculated by using the conversion factor of 0.5 specified there.

The implementation is the use of the SRECS in accordance with the documented SRECS design. Ensure that the following requirements are observed: • The appropriate parts of the SRECS safety requirements. • The relevant requirements for wiring and cabling practice in accordance with IEC 60204-1 • The requirements for avoiding systematic hardware failures. • The requirements for controlling systematic failures. During the validation, the inspection and testing ensure that the design of each SRCF safety function meets the requirements of the specification.

Larger switching devices obtain this effect by the fast and wide opening of the contacts, leading quickly to an arc resistance which also limits the current.

Any modification to a machine, regardless of whether the machine is used or new, that may prejudice the legal rights set forth in ProdSG, e.g, as a result of output increases, functional changes, changes in intended use, etc., must first be assessed in terms of its safety-relevant impact. This means that it is necessary to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the modification to the (used) machine has resulted in new hazards or whether an existing risk has been increased. Three different scenarios can be assumed:1. There is no new hazard or no increased risk so that the machine can still be considered as safe. 2. There is a new hazard or an increased risk, but the machine’ s safety measures that existed before the modification are sufficient for the machine to continue to be deemed safe. 3. There is a new hazard or an increased risk, and the existing safety measures are not sufficient to deal with it. Additional safety measures are not required in the case of altered machines that fall under case 1 or 2. In contrast, altered machines that fall under case 3 must be evaluated with a risk assessment in order to determine whether there is a substantial modification. The first step is to determine whether it is possible to make the machine safe again with the use of simple protective devices, i.e., so that the risk does not increase in comparison to the machine’ s original safe condition. If this is the case, the modification can generally be considered not to be substantial. Otherwise, a more extensive risk assessment must be conducted.

Interpretation paper of the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs on the subject of „Substantial Modifications to Machinery“ [„Wesentliche Veränderung von Maschinen“] (Announcement of the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs from April 9, 2015 concerning the German Product Safety Act / Ninth Ordinance to the Product Safety Act [9. ProdSV]) Replacing machine components with identical components or with components with the exact same function and safety level, as well as installing protective devices that result in an increase in the machine’s safety level and that do not provide any additional functions, is not considered making substantial modifications. Note: Regardless of this, other legal regulations may require employers that provide their employees with machinery for use as work equipment to establish additional safety measures. Generally, a risk assessment must be conducted in accordance with § 3 of the German Ordinance on Industrial Safety and Health 9 (Betriebssicherheitsverordnung 9) after any modifications are made to machines, including modifications that are not considered substantial. This assessment is part of the industrial occupational health and safety obligations of any user of a machine or system using this machine or system as work equipment. This risk assessment may render measures - especially technical measures - necessary in order to provide employees with safe work equipment.

The design of the safety functions in the protection system in order to ensure they provide sufficient reliability is a key ingredient. As help for this there is, for example, the EN ISO 13849-1 standard. With this document we aim to provide an introduction to the standard and its application in conjunction with our products. Introducing the new standard The generation change for standards on safety in control systems introduces new concepts and calculations for machine builders and machine users. The EN 954-1 standard (categories) is being phased out and replaced by EN ISO 13849-1 (PL, Performance Level) and EN 62061 (SIL, Safety Integrity Level). Although the deadline for using EN 954-1 is set to 31/12/2011, it is beneficial to start applying the new standards as soon as possible as many new standards no longer refer to EN 954-1. PL or SIL? What should I use? The standard you should use depends on the choice of technology, experience and customer requirements. Choice of technology • PL (Performance Level) is a technology-neutral concept that can be used for electrical, mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic safety solutions. • SIL (Safety Integrity Level) can, however, only be used for electrical, electronic or programmable safety solutions. Experience EN ISO 13849-1 uses categories from EN 954-1 for defining the system structure, and therefore the step to the new calculations is not so great if you have previous experience of the categories. EN 62061 defines the structures slightly differently. Customer requirements If the customer comes from an industry",

We notice that most of our customers prefer PL as it is technology-neutral and that they can use their previous knowledge in the categories. In this document we show some examples of how to build safety solutions in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1 and calculate the reliability of the safety functions to be used for a particular machine. The examples in this document are simplified in order to provide an understanding of the principles. The values used in the examples can change. What is PL (Performance Level)? PL is a measure of the reliability of a safety function. PL is divided into five levels (a-e). PL e gives the best reliability and is equivalent to that required at the highest level of risk. To calculate which level the PL system achieves you need to know the following: • The system’s structure (categories B, 1-4) • The Mean Time To dangerous Failure of the component (MTTFd) • The system’s Diagnostic Coverage (DC) You will also need to: • protect the system against a failure that knocks out both channels (CCF) • protect the system from systematic errors built into the design • follow certain rules to ensure software can be developed and validated in the right way The five PL -levels (a-e) correspond to certain ranges of PFHD- values (probability of dangerous failure per hour). These indicate how likely it is that a dangerous failure could occur over a period of one hour. In the calculation, it is beneficial to use PFHD-values directly as the PL is a simplification that does not provide equally accurate results. What is the easiest way of complying with the standard? 1. Use pre-calculated",

The EN ISO 12100 standard (combination of EN ISO 14121-1 and EN ISO 12100-1/-2) stipulates the requirements for the risk assessment of a machine. It is this that EN ISO 13849-1 is based on, and a completed risk assessment is a prerequisite for being able to work with the standard. Step 1 – Risk assessment A risk assessment begins with determining the scope of the machine. This includes the space that the machine and its operators need for all of its intended applications, and all operational stages throughout the machine’s life cycle. All risk sources must then be identified for all work operations throughout the machine’s life cycle. A risk estimation is made for each risk source, i.e. indication of the degree of risk. According to EN ISO 13849-1 the risk is estimated using three factors: injury severity (S, severity), frequency of exposure to the risk (F, frequency) and the possibility you have of avoiding or limiting the injury (P, possibility). For each factor two options are given. Where the boundary between the two options lies is not speciﬁed in the standard, but the following are common interpretations: S1 bruises, abrasions, puncture wounds and minor crushing injuries S2 skeletal injuries, amputations and death F1 less frequently than every two weeks F2 more often than every two weeks P1 slow machine movements, plenty of space, low power P2 quick machine movements, crowded, high power By setting S, F and P for the risk, you will get the PLr Performance Level (required) that is necessary for the risk source. Finally, the risk assessment includes a risk evaluation where you determine if the risk needs to be reduced or if sufficient",

(Examples of safety function s are emergency stop and monitoring of gate.) For each safety function , a PLr should be established (which has often already been made in the risk assessment). The solution for the safety function is then designed and implemented. Once the design is complete, you can calculate the PL the safety function achieves. Check that the calculated PL is at least as high as PLr and then validate the system as per the validation plan.

Avoid the risk already at the design stage. (For example, reduce power, avoid interference in the danger zone.) 2. Use protection and/or safety devices. (For example, fences, light grids or control devices.) 3. Provide information about how the machine can be used safely. (For example, in manuals and on signs.)

The manufacturer of switches, sensors and logic devices often have PL and PFHD-values for their components, but for output devices (such as contactors and valves) you do not usually specify a value as it depends on how often the component will be used. You can then either calculate yourself according to EN ISO 13849-1 or use the pre- calculated example solutions such as those from ABB Jokab Safety. To calculate PL or PFHD for a block, you need to know its category, DC and MTTFd.

If the manufacturer cannot provide values, they are given from tables in EN ISO 13849-1 or you have to calculate MTTFd using the B10d-value, (average number of cycles until 10 % of the components have a dangerous If you use a safety PLC for implementing safety functions, this places requirements on how the software is developed and validated. To avoid error conditions, the software should be readable, understandable and be possible to test and maintain. A software specification must be prepared to ensure that you can check the functionality of the program. It is also important to divide the program into modules that can be tested individually. Paragraph 4.6 and Appendix J of EN ISO 13849-1 specify requirements for safety related software.The following are examples of requirements for software from EN ISO 13849-1: • A development life cycle must be produced with validation measures that indicate how and when the program should be validated, for example, following a change. • The specification and design must be documented. • Function tests must be performed. • Validated functional blocks must be used whenever possible. • Data and control flow are to be described using, for example, a condition diagram or software flow chart.Requirements for safety-related softwareCalculation of the average number of cycles is as follows: dop • hop • 3600 tcyclenop =B10d 0,1 • nopMTTFd",

    "text": "= nop = Number of cycles per year dop = Operation days per year hop = Operation hours per day tcycle = Cycle time (seconds)failure). To calculate the MTTFd, you also need to know the average number of cycles per year that the component will execute. With a B10d=2·106 this gives a MTTFd=1,141 year which corresponds to MTTFd=high. Note that when you calculate MTTFd you have to calculate according to the total number of cycles the component will be working. A typical example of this is the contactors that frequently work for several safety functions simultaneously. This means that you must add the number of estimated cycles per year from all the safety functions that use the contactors. When MTTFd is calculated from a B10d-value, also consider that if the MTTFd-value is less than 200 years, the component needs to be replaced after 10 % of the MTTFd- value (due to the T10d-value). That is, a component with MTTFd = 160 years needs to be replaced after 16 years in order for the conditions for achieving PL to continue to be valid. This is because EN ISO 13849-1 is based on a “mission time” of 20 years. Common Cause Failure (CCF) In Appendix F of EN ISO 13849-1 there is a table of actions to be taken to protect against CCF, to ensure a failure does not knock out both channels.

The operator starts station 1 manually. The pneumatic machining tool performs work on the workpiece in station 1. The operator then places the machined workpiece on the conveyor belt for transfer to station 2. The robot then takes the workpiece that is placed in the hydraulic press. The workpiece leaves the cell by transport out onto the conveyor. The work that needs to be done in station 2 is, for example, to address operational disturbances in the press and the robot (a few times a week, F2). Unexpected start-ups of the robot are expected to cause serious injury (S2). The operator is deemed not to have the possibility of avoiding injury as the robot moves quickly (P2). The assessment for the safety function required for access to station 2 is PLr=e (S2, F2, P2). This assessment would still be the same in respect of the press. For the safety function for the risks associated with the conveyor belt, the assessment S1, F2, P1 is made giving PLr= b. Step 2 – Reduce the risk As protection, interlocked doors are selected with the Eden non-contact sensor. Station 1 with the pneumatic machining tool is operated by",

Station 2 can be in automatic mode, when a light curtain (Focus) and a non-contact sensor at door 4 (Eden) protects the entry. If the door is opened or the light curtain is breached, station 2 stops in a safe manner. By opening doors 2 and 3 (also monitored by Eden) the conveyor belt and the pneumatic machining tool will stop safely. Manual reset must always be done after actuation by any safety device. When the protection system requires a number of safety devices and that multiple machines must be checked, safety PLC Pluto is the most effective solution. If the protection system also has to work by zones and in different modes of operation, this is another compelling reason to use Pluto.

    "text": "is required is not difficult, especially if you use “pre-calculated” safety devices and logic units. But what parts should then be included in each safety function? This must be resolved before you start calculating phase. To summarise in simple terms you can say that each safety device gives rise to a safety function for each machine that is affected by the safety device in question. Three safety devices that all cut the power to three machines in a cell is therefore equal to nine safety functions. In the section that follows, we explain the background. Three safety functions (SF) are defined for the machine and are calculated as: SF1: PFHD, F1 + PFHD, K1 + PFHD, Q1= PFHD, SF1 SF2: PFHD, B1 + PFHD, K1 + PFHD, Q1= PFHD, SF2 SF3: PFHD, S1 + PFHD, K1 + PFHD, Q1= PFHD, SF3 Multiple safety functions for multiple machines in a cell More commonly, several machines in a single cell/zone are to be protected by multiple safety devices. The following figure illustrates the interconnection schematically for an example. Each of the machines Q1 – Q3 is shut down separately and independently of K1.If the operator enters the cell, he is exposed in this case to the same type of risk from all three machines. The power to all three machines must be cut when the operator enters the cell through the door interlocked by B1. Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 | 15Conclusions • Use the practical approach. • Use safety devices/logic units with high reliability (low PFHD) to make it easy to achieve the PLr required. • With Vital or Pluto, it is easier to achieve the PLr required.Theoretical approach for multiple machines The theoretical approach to calculate the safety function is as follows:Practical approach for multiple machines",

    "text": "A more practical approach is to divide the safety function into three parts, one for each of the three machines. This is an approach that can provide a more accurate way of Sources: www.dguv.de/ifa/de/pub/grl/pdf/2009_249.pdf www.bg-metall.de/praevention/fachausschuesse/ infoblatt/deutsch.html (No 047, Date 05/2010)For the full safety function to be performed you require all the components to be working. Note that if B1 or K1 has a dangerous malfunction, the entire safety function is disabled. However, if for example machine Q1 has a dangerous malfunction, and is not shut down, machines Q2 and Q3 will still be shut down. One disadvantage in considering the safety function in this way is that you may have trouble achieving the PLr required. But if you achieve the PLr required, you can use the theoretical approach. The risk assessment for the safety functions needed for the risks associated with the robot was S2, F2, P2, which resulted in PLr=e. The same assessment was made for the hydraulic press: PLr=e. The assessment of the pneumatic machining tool is S2, F2, P1 giving PLr= d due to the fact that the assessment is that there is the possibility of avoiding risk.Interlock switch B1, Eden, is to cut the power to all machines in the danger zone: • Robot Q1 (PFHD, Q1 = 5.79·10-8) • Hydraulic press Q2 (PFHD, Q2 = 8·10-8) • Pneumatic machining tool Q3 (PFHD, Q3 = 2·10-7).looking at the safety functions, especially where a different PLr is required for the safety functions above. If machine Q1 is a robot and machine Q2 is a conveyor which is designed to have negligible risks, the different PLr required to protect against risks from Q1 and Q2 will also be different. This practical approach is therefore the one recommended. The interpretation is based on information provided by IFA (Institut für",

Theoretical approach If you use the practical approach the safety functions are as follows: Robot: PFHD, B1 + PFHD, K1 + PFHD, Q1 = 4,5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 5.79·10-8 = 6.44·10-8 PL e Hydraulic press: PFHD, B1 + PFHD, K1 + PFHD, Q2 = 4.5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 8·10-8 = 8.65·10-8 PL e Pneumatic machining tool: PFHD, B1 + PFHD, K1 + PFHD, Q3 = 4.5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 2·10-7 = 2.07·10-7 PL d This is to be done in a similar way with other safety functions for the cell. For each safety device, you define the machines it affects, and establish the various safety functions according to this. Theoretical approach How would it have worked if you had used the theoretical approach? Would the safety function have achieved PL e? All machines: PFHD, B1 + PFHD, K1 + PFHD, Q1 + PFHD, Q2 + PFHD, Q3 = 4,5 ·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 5.79 ·10-8 + 8·10-8 + 2·10-7 = 3.44 ·10-7 PL d In this case, the safety function would therefore have not achieved a total PL e, which was required for the risks associated with the robot and hydraulic press.

This means that all new machinery must fulfill the same legal requirements when supplied throughout the EU. The same standards (IEC/ISO versions) are also recognized in many areas outside Europe, for example through equivalency charts, which facilitates machinery trade and machine shipments between countries within and outside the EU. Why must machinery meet these requirements? Because conformity helps to prevent accidents and consequent injury. Furthermore, by complying with the Machinery Directive and the relevant harmonized standards or outside Europe complying with the relevant functional safety standards, machine manufacturers can rest assured they have met their obligations to design and deliver safe machines that comply with national laws. For manufacturers, new and improved safety strategies are becoming a way of improving their productivity and competitiveness in the market. The aim of conventional safety systems has been to achieve comprehensive operational safety and meet legal obligations. This has been done by using add-on electrical and mechanical components, even at the cost of productivity. Operators can, in certain circumstances, override these systems when attempting to improve productivity, which can lead to accidents. With modern safety systems, the safety of the processes and the operator can be taken into account while maintaining productivity. One example of this is keeping the machine running but at a lower speed to maintain safe",

    "text": "operation. With modern safety solutions, safety can be an integrated part of machine functionality, and safety solutions are not just afterthoughts, added in order to meet regulations. Safety systems can be implemented effectively through defined processes, to achieve specific risk reduction capability and use certified subsystems as building blocks for safety systems. The process concepts and the methods laid out in the functional safety standards are introduced in this guide. Meeting safety standards is expected in the industry, and certified subsystems such as drives with pre-designed safety functions are important in the industry. Machine safety is one of the most rapidly growing areas of importance in industrial automation. PART 1 – THEORY AND BACKGROUND7 — Safety and functional safety The purpose of safety is to protect people and the environment from accidents and risks caused by machines. Functional safety systems do this by lowering the probability of undesired events, so that mishaps are minimized when operating machinery. Safety standards define safety as freedom from unacceptable risk. Acceptable risk levels are defined by means of required risk reduction in the machinery safety standards. Machine builders should always use the same (the most stringent) acceptability criteria for all market areas, regardless of regional differences. The most effective way to eliminate risks is to design machines to be inherently safe. But if risk reduction by design is not possible or practical, safeguarding through static guards or safety functions is often the best option. Machine safety functions can be used to reduce the risks caused by movement while maintainingmachine productivity, uptime and usability. At the same time, the legal obligations are met and the safety of people and the environment is ensured. Functional safety in machinery usually means systems that safely monitor and, when necessary, take control of the machine applications to ensure safe",

    "text": "operation. Functional safety systems are designed to detect hazardous conditions or user’s demand for safe state, and bring machine /process to a safe state, or to ensure that the desired action, such as safe stopping, takes place. Monitoring typically include speed, stopping, direction of rotation, and standstill. When the safety system is executing an active safety function, for example moni - toring a crawl speed, and the system behavior deviates from what is expected (for example, the system runs too fast), the safety system detects the deviation and actively brings machine operation to a safe state. This can be done, for example, by stopping the machine safely and removing the torque from the motor shaft. A safety system is not part of standard control system of the machine, and any failure in the safety system will immediately increase the risks related to machine. This could lead in to hazardous situation as, the machine might still work normally, but the safety function might not be functional when it is needed. Especially in the high risk applications, safety system must be redundant or at least monitored, so that faults in the safety system can't lead to hazardous situation. 8 TECHNICAL GUIDE NO. 10 FUNCTIONAL SAFETY — Machinery Directive The Machinery Directive, with the harmonized standards listed thereunder, defines the Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSR) for machinery at European Union level. The EHSRs are listed in Annex I of the Machinery Directive. The idea behind the Machinery Directive is to ensure that a machine is safe and that it is designed and constructed so that it can be used, configured and maintained throughout all phases of its life, causing minimal risk to people and the environment.

Eliminate or minimize the hazards as much as possible by considering safety aspects in the machine design and construction phases (design machine to be inherently safe). 2. Apply the necessary protection measures against hazards that cannot be eliminated. 3. Inform users of the risks that remain despite all feasible protection measures being taken, while specifying any requirements for training or personal protective equipment. Complying with the EHSR of the Machinery Directive allows the machine manufacturer to affix the CE marking on the machine. With CE marking the manufacturer guarantees that the product meets all regulations on the free movement of goods, as well as the essential requirements of the relevant European Directives, in this case the Machinery Directive. Note: There might also be other directives that apply, e.g. Low voltage directive and EMC directive. Only Machinery Directive requirements are covered in this guide.

Thus, the manufacturer of the product, or the representative of the manufacturer, is responsible for CE marking, not the manufacturer of the component that is included in the final product. As an exception, the safety components to be used in the safety functions of the machine, are CE marked according to Machinery Directive by the component manufacturer/representative in Europe. The machine manufacturer is responsible for carrying out the related risk analysis, following through the steps presented in Part 3, and ensuring compliance with the requirements.

All harmonized standards carry the prefix “EN” (NOTE: not all EN standards are harmonized standards). A list of the harmonized standards for machinery can be found on the European Commission Internet pages, http://ec.europa.eu . The majority of harmonized standards are referenced by one or more Directives. To ensure that the essential requirements of the Machinery Directive are followed, it is advisable to apply the appropriate harmonized European standards. By designing machines according to these standards, manufacturers can demonstrate that they comply with the Machinery Directive and, generally, do not require certification by a third party.

PART 2 – MACHINERY STANDARDS13 The standard defines how the required Performance Level (PL) is determined and the achieved PL verified within a system. PL describes how well a safety system is able to perform a safety function, under foreseeable conditions. There are five possible Performance Levels: a, b, c, d and e. Performance Level “e” provides the highest risk reduction capability, while PL “a” provides the lowest. EN ISO 13849-2 specifies the validation process and required design measures/ techniques for safety functions designed according to EN ISO 13849-1.

The Safe torque off (STO) function can be used to effectively implement the prevention of unexpected startup functionality, thus making stops safe by preventing the power only to the motor, while still maintaining power to the main drive control circuits. Prevention of unexpected startup requires for example a lockable switch in addition to the STO function.

Compliance with the Machinery Directive can be achieved:• by meeting the requirements set by the harmonized standards or • by having a machine acceptance investigation carried out by an authorized third party. The process for fulfilling the EHSRs of the Machinery Directive using harmonized standards can be divided into nine steps: • Step 1: Management of functional safety – managing functional safety during the life cycle of the machine. • Step 2: Risk assessment – analyzing and evaluating risks. • Step 3: Risk reduction – eliminating or minimizing risks through design and documentation. • Step 4: Establishing safety requirements – defining what is needed (functionality, safety performance) to eliminate the risk or reduce it to an acceptable level. • Step 5: Implementing a functional safety system – designing and creating safety functions. • Step 6: Verifying a functional safety system – ensuring that the safety system meets the defined requirements. • Step 7: Validating a functional safety system – reviewing implemented safety system against the risk assessment and making certain that the safety system actually succeeded in reducing risks as specified. • Step 8: Documenting a functional safety system – documenting the design, producing user documentation. • Step 9: Providing compliance – proving the machine’s compliance with EHSR of the Machinery Directive through compliance assessment and a technical file.

The Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC requires that manufacturers perform risk assessments and take the results into account when designing a machine. All risks must be assessed and if necessary, they must be reduced to an acceptable level using design changes or by applying appropriate safeguarding techniques. The risk assessment process according to EN ISO 12100 consists of two parts: risk analysis and risk evaluation. Risk analysis means identifying and estimating the risks and risk evaluation means deciding whether the risk is acceptable or risk reduction necessary. Risk evaluation is carried out based on the results of the risk analysis. Decisions on the necessity of risk reduction are made according to the risk evaluation procedure. Note: Risk evaluation must be carried out separately for each hazard. 22 TECHNICAL GUIDE NO. 10 FUNCTIONAL SAFETY Four steps of risk analysis: 1. Determine the limits and intended use of",

Designers should also seek valuable user input when defining protective measures. When the risk reduction has been executed, it must be examined to ensure that the measures taken were adequate for reducing the risk to an appropriate level. This can be done by repeating the risk assessment process. The following, remaining steps describe option 2 of the 3-step method: safeguarding through a functional safety solution. — Step 4: Establishing safety requirements After all the risk reduction that can be undertaken through design changes has been performed, additional safeguarding needs to be specified. Functional safety solutions can be used against the remaining hazards as an additional risk reduction measure. Safety functions A safety function is a function, which must function properly and provide designed protection for the user of the machine. Failure of such function can put machine users in immediate risk as the safe usage of the machine might be endangered. Simply put, it comprises the measures that must be taken to reduce the likelihood of an unwanted event occurring during exposure to a hazard. A safety function is not part of machine operation itself. This means that if the safety function fails, the machine can operate normally, but the risk of injury from machine operation increases. Defining a safety function always includes two components: • required action (what must be done to reduce the risk) and • safety performance (Safety Integrity Level – SIL or Performance Level – PL). Note:It is also important to specify the timing requirements for the safety function, ie the maximum allowed time to bring the system into a safe state. 26 TECHNICAL GUIDE NO. 10 FUNCTIONAL SAFETY Also the environment for the",

Example of a safety function: Risk, which requires risk reduction: An exposed rotating shaft may cause an injury if one gets too close to the shaft. Action: In order to prevent personal injury from the shaft, the motor must stop in one (1) second, when the safety gate is opened.After the safety function that executes the action has been defined, the required safety level is determined for it. Safety performance/integrity Safety integrity measures the performance of a safety function. It presents the likelihood of the safety function being achieved, upon request. The required safety integrity for a function is determined during the risk assessment and is represented by the achieved Safety Integrity Level (SIL) or Performance Level (PL), depending on the standard used. The two standards use different evaluation techniques for a safety function, but their results are comparable. The terms and definitions are similar for both standards. Determining the required SIL (EN/IEC 62061) The process for determining the required safety integrity level (SIL) is as follows: 1. Determine the severity of the consequence of a hazardous event. 2. Determine the point value for the frequency and duration a person is exposed to the harm. 3. Determine the point value for the probability of the hazardous event occurring when exposed to it. 4. Determine the point value for the possibility of preventing or limiting the scope of the harm.

After the PL has been defined, the implementation of the safety system can begin. — Step 5: Implementing a functional safety system When designing and constructing a safety function, the idea is to plan and construct the safety function in order to meet the required SIL/PL specified for the function (as shown in the previous chapter). Using certified subsystems in functional safety systems can save the safety system designer a lot of work. Implementing safety functions becomes more convenient when some of the safety and reliability calculations are already made and subsystems are certified. Note: SIL/PL of the whole safety function must be assessed, calculated and verified. If safety function includes components (subsystems), which are not certified by component manufacturer, it is necessary to carry out SIL/PL assessment including safety calculations for each of the subsystems. Standards EN/IEC 62061 and EN ISO 13849-1 include information on the process and calculation data needed. Implementation and verification processes are iterative and run parallel with each other. The idea is to use verify during implementation to ensure that the safety functionality and SIL/PL level reached with the implemented system. For more information on the verification processes, see the next step. ABB’s Functional safety design tool (FSDT-01) is a PC-tool available for establishing a SIL/PL target for a safety function, as well as to design, verify the achieved SIL/PL and document the safety function. 30 TECHNICAL GUIDE NO. 10 FUNCTIONAL SAFETY The general steps for implementing a functional safety system include: 1.

All residual risk must be documented in the user documentation, withproper instructions on how to operate the machine safely. The documentation must be accessible and maintainable. The user documentation is delivered with the machine. For more information on the documentation required and its nature, see the EHSR in Annex I of the Machinery Directive. PART 3 – STEPS TO MEET MACHINERY DIRECTIVE REQUIREMENTS37 — Step 9: Proving compliance Before a machine can be placed on the market, the manufacturer must ensure that the machine is implemented in conformance with harmonized standards. It must also be proved that the combination for each safety function of the safety-related parts meets the defined requirements. To prove the conformance with the Machinery Directive, it must be shown that: •",

    "text": "the report describes shortly how to perform a risk assessment and define an appropriate PL r (Performance Level required) fo r each identified safety function. A central part of EN ISO 13849-1:2008 is to choose an appropriate category for the identified safety functions. Categories were used also in the earlier machinery safety standard EN 954-1:1996. The report describes in detail the meaning of each category and also gives an example of a category 2 safety function. The next step after the identification of an appropriate category is to determine the hardware reliability for each safety func tion. The report gives both background information about reliability theory and how to perform these calculations in practice. Diagnostic coverage is anothe r important are in EN ISO 13849-1:2008 that together with the category and MTTF d determines which PL that is possible to reach. The report gives a number of examples on how different diagnostic coverage techniques can look like. The report also briefly discusses systematic failures, what it means and how to handle these during design and use of safety functions. Software requirements are another area that is described in the report, where the report describes the difference between different ki nds of programming languages and what it means to follow the V-model defined in EN ISO 13849-1:2008. Finally the report describes a number of different methods to check that the PL r is reached. This report shall be considered as an complement to the standard EN ISO 13849-1:2008 that gives examples on how different requirements can be interpreted. 11 1 Introduction 1.1 Abbreviations Table 1: Abbreviations B10 The expected time at which 10% of the population will fail C Duty cycle DC Diagnostic Coverage DC avg Diagnostic Coverage Average E/E/PE Electrical/Electronic/Programmable electronic HW Hardware L Logic MTBF Mean Time Between Failure",

Common rules in the different countries makes it easier to know which essential health- and safety requirements to be followed. The machinery directive has been reworked and the new version is valid from the 29th of December 2009. The safety of control systems is described in Clause 1.2.1 in Appendix 1 of the machinery directive. Control systems must be designed and construc ted in such a way as to prevent hazardous situations from arising. Above all, they must be designed and constructed in such a way that: • they can withstand the intended opera ting stresses and external influences, • a fault in the hardware or the software of the control system does not lead to hazardous situations, • errors in the control system logic do not lead to hazardous situations, 12 • reasonably foreseeable human error during op eration does not lead to hazardous situations. Particular attention must be given to the following points: • the machinery must not start unexpectedly, • the parameters of the machinery must not change in an uncontrolled way, where such change may lead to hazardous situations, • the machinery must not be prevented from stopping if the stop command has already been given, • no moving part",

For cable-less control, an automatic stop mu st be activated when correct control signals are not received, including loss of communication. The reworked version of the machinery direc tive that is valid from the 29th of December 2009 does in principle have the same requireme nts as in the earlier version, but with the following additions: • Predict human misbehaviour. The purpose is to reduce the risk of operational mistakes by using different kinds of ergonomic principles. • The parameter setting of the machine is not allowed to be changed in an uncontrolled way. One example could for in stance be that the processing speed of a machine is changed remotely without i ndicating this change to the operator of the machine. • All safety-related parts of the mach ine shall work in a coherent way • An automatic stop of the machine shall occur if no correct control signals are received via the wireless control. Loss of communication or disturbed messages shall not lead to a dangerous situation These rules have earlier been applied in most machine control systems but now they are also specified in the machinery directive.

Both [2] and [3] contain clauses describing requirements concerning management of functional safety. When working with the standard, at least the following parts are recommended to apply: • Develop a functional safety plan, describing: - Activities during the project - Identify persons and organisations res ponsible for different activities during the project - Competence of the persons involved in the different activities, Clause 6.2.13 and 6.2.14 in [3] give a good description - How to document the different steps in the project - Requirements when performing modification in the component/system, Clause 9 in [2] gives a good description - How to perform the verification (can be efficient to split up in a separate document) - How to perform the validation (can be efficient to split up in a separate document) - How to handle issues identified dur ing for instance risk analysis, verifications, validations, audits, re views by independent organisations, incident reporting - Which requirements that shall be placed on suppliers The most important part concerning the functional safety plan is to find out how to implement it so it becomes easy to use and an integral part of the design process. Guidance: • It is important to early in the project to decide which documents that shall be developed by you as a manufacturer/integr ator, and which documents that shall be developed by the organisation responsi ble for the evaluation/certification, for more information see Clause 10 in the standard • Involve the organisation responsible for evaluation/certification as early as possible in the project.

Additionally, you must also be able to show that your system is safe by showing th at you have correctly documented all parts of your development, from the initial risk analysis until the component/system is finalized 15 • The functional safety plan is an important document during all parts of the project life cycle and needs to continuously be updated as the project proceeds • Documentation of good quality not only simplifies for you as a manufacturer/- integrator, but also for the organisation responsible for the evaluation/- certification. In some situations, for instance when a company does not already have existing procedures it may be efficient to build up the document structure in accordance with the clauses and requireme nts as described in the standard • If possible, it is preferable to integrate the process requirements from the standard into the normal processes of the company to avoid having two different management systems • A problem is to follow the functional safety plan developed during the whole project and also after the project is fi nalized and possibly evaluated/certified by another organization, and thus it is importa nt to design the functional safety plan in such way that it is applicable and usable • Take into consideration if it could be efficient to use a program that handles management of functional safety 16 Figure 1 The safety function workflow from ISO 13849-1 Figure 3 in the standard (see Figure 1 above) describes the work flow from identifying that a safety function shall be performed by SRP/CS until the safety function has been validated.

The following “Requirements on requirements” are suitable to take into consideration when developing the safety requirements specification documentation. • Unique – only one requirement exists addressing a specific aspect • Atomic – the requirement addresses one aspect. This also improves the possibility of modifications (less dependences with other requirements) • Complete – within the scope of the individual requirement • Unambiguous – no room for different interpretations • Identifiable – can be uniquely referenced • Correct – shall address what is intended • Concise – a focussed formulation • Verifiable – e.g. by using tests, analysis, inspection, proofs etc. • Traceable – both to upper and lower level requirements • Understandable – i.e. anybody can understand the requirement. This might be somewhat in conflict with Concise. • Rationale – a motivation for the requirement. This is necessary since this will improve the understanding of the indivi dual requirement as",

Guidance: • For companies developing only a SRP/CS, the safety requirements specification will look different compared to a company developing a complete safety function, for instance: - The PLr will be based on a judgment of the market expectations. - It will only include requirements on the specific SRP/CS and not for the complete safety function. • The safety requirements specification shall describe the functional requirements for each safety function, and thus it is important to not include any implementation-specific requirements. • The quality of the safety requirements specification will be increased if a number of persons with different competences are included in the work, for instance persons working with development, servi ce and quality issues. Another efficient 18 method is to let someone who has not been involved in the development of the document review the safety requirements specification. • Check the “Requirements on requirements” when developing the safety requirements specification document • Motivate how each risk parameter is chosen in Figure A.1 — “Risk graph for determining required PLr for safety fu nction” in the standard. For more information see Chapter 3. • Go through Chapter 5.1 and 5.2 in the standard to get guidance concerning which information that shall be included in the safety requirements specification • When the safety requirements specification documentation is ready, it is possible to start writing the safety validation plan, which describes how each specific requirement in the safety requirements specification will be validated. 4. This phase concerns the design and technical realisation of the safety functions.

When all safety functions and their corresponding SRP/CSs are identified, the next step is to go on with the design of the safety functi on.

This method is described in Table 11 in the standard and also in Chapter 9.3 in this report. 20 Another usual situation for a machine builder is that the control system used in the safety function is developed according to [3], [4], [5]. In this case it is possible to check in Table 4 in the standard and transform the SIL level for the control system to a corresponding PL. Guidance: • The simplified method in Chapter 4.5.4 in the standard can only be used if the architecture of the safety function corresponds to one of the designated architectures. • The approach when using the simplifie d method is to first choose a certain designated architecture and then go on with the calculations of MTTF d and DC avg. If the PL r is not reached, it is possible to change the designated architecture and/or change MTTF d and/or change the DC avg. 21 • If the PL for each SRP/CS is known, it is possible to use Table 11 in the standard to determine the PL for the safety function. In this case it is important to consider the interfaces between these different SR P/CSs and check in the safety manuals for each SRP/CS how it shall be connected to other SRP/CS. • For other architectures, it is instead possibl e to apply the methods described in [4] when performing the hardware reliability calculations. 22 3 Risk assessment The risk assessment is performed",

And then check by using Table 3 in the standard which PL r that corresponds to each PFH D. 25 By combining these tables it is possible to say from a risk assessment view that: • SIL 3 corresponds to PL r=e • SIL 2 corresponds to PL r=d • SIL 1 corresponds to PL r=c (this is a conservative approach because the probability of dangerous failure per hour interval for SIL 1 covers both PL r=b and PLr=c) When performing the risk assessment outgoing from Table A.3 in [2] it is not possible to reach PLa and PLb. 26 4 Category and designated architectures The categories represent resistance to hardware faults, and have previously been the most common used principle in order to design a control system that have an appropriate level of safety for the risks that are present for the intended use of the machine. The category is one of the sub requirements of a PL and there is a possibility within a PL to choose different categories. The category is essential to take into consid eration during the first design phase since the category affects both the hardware design a nd the software design.

It is important to remember that in some cases some the categories is not suitable for the final application because the checking of th e safety function cannot be applied to all components, see Chapter 4.1.3.1. What is a category? The category describes resistance to faults and the behavior of the machine or the control system in the case a fault occurs in the saf ety related part of a control system. The category is defined in the standard as: There are five types of categories defined: B, 1, 2, 3, 4 and thus we have five different types of fault resistances defined. The category was previous (EN 954-1:1996) the measure to reduce the risk by selecting an appropriate category according to the risks analysis. If the risk for a machine is estimated to be high, and we suppose that the result of a risk assessment gives Performance Level required (PL r) = d for a specific safety function. The following is possible: • category 2 or category 3 structure can be used • category B or category 1 structure are not fulfilling requirements for PL r = d • category 4 structure is in this case possible but will give higher design requirements for the estimated ri sk according to the standard The principle for the categories (resistance to faults) is almost identical if we compare requirements from the standard and EN 954-1:1996 but MTTF d, DC avg and CCF need also to be considered. 4.1 Designated architectures The designated architectures are presented by an graphical structure with boxes and arrows for each category by",

All hardware components has a probability of failure per unit time, this probability is ca lled the component failure rate and is denoted with the symbol λ(lambda). Failure rate is often estim ated in failures in time (FIT) which means that if a component has a failure rate of 1 FIT then the probability of failure for that component is 9101−× per hour. The failure rate for a certain type of co mponent can be subdivided into three phases according to the following figure: θ Figure 11 Bathtub curve 41 Phase 1 is the early life of the component. During this period the failure rate is expected to be high because of e.g. a not suffi ciently adjusted manufacturing process. During phase 2 the failure rate is assumed to be constant for electric/electronic, hydraulic and pneumatic components. This period is ca lled the useful life of the component which often is symbolized with θ(theta). Phase 3 is the wear out phase which starts when the useful life of the component ends. In this phase the component is worn out because of physical reasons and the failure rate cannot longer be assumed to be constant. Because the failure rate is assumed to be cons tant during the useful life period it can be shown that the mean time to failure (MTTF) can be calculated according to: ] [1hours MTTFλ= It is very important to make a difference between the MTTF and the θ because these two measures have no relationship.

Usually MTTR << MTTF (e.g. 8 hours compared with 3500 years). The term MTBF is normally important in maintainability/availability analysis and will not be further considered in this report. 5.1.2 Relation between MTTF and MTTFd Example Consider a relay with one contact supplying a motor. The failure rate for the relay is known (REλ). The relay has two failure modes, st uck open or stuck closed and the relay manufacturer has specified that if a relay failu re occurs, it is equally probable that any of these failure modes occur. This is called dist ribution of the failure rate among the failure modes of a component. Reliability prediction handbooks may provide guidance for distribution for certain types of components (but not for all types) if not the distribution is carried out by good engineering practice.

Always check if the manufacturer specifies th e MTTFd value in the component datasheet. In some cases the datasheet only contains a PFH value or a Dλ value (this is common for electronic modules such as I/O modules and senso rs). In this case use the formula MTTFd = 1/Dλ However, for standard passive components (t ransistors, diodes, resistors etc.) use the following guideline: The latter technique is the most common for electronic components.

B 10d is the number of operations a set of electromechanical or pneumatic components can perform until 10% of the set of components faile d dangerously. This value is derived in a B10-test and is to be acquired from the component manufacturer. The B 10d-value is used to estimate the M TTFd for the components. However, B 10d-values are not considered applicable for hydraulic components. The reason for this is not motivated in the standard. In order to be able to use Table C. 1 in the standard which prescribes B 10d-values for electromechanical, pneumatic components and a MTTFd value for hydraulic components the requirements in Annex C.2 and C.3 shall be documented by the component manufacturer, e.g. in the datasheet. Otherw ise the manufacturer shall deliver the B 10d value or the MTTFd value. With a B 10d value available, the following formul a may be used for deriving the MTTFd- value: opd nBMTTFd×=1,010 Where n op is the mean number of annual operations for the component.

Recalling Chapter 5.1.1 in this report, the fa ilure rate for a component can be subdivided into different fractions depending on the com ponents different failure mode effects on the control system (Dλand Sλ). If automatic self-checking and error detecting mechanisms are included in the control system and which detects certain dangerous failures a third fraction can be derived from the FMEA called DDλwhich means dangerous detected failure rate. What is diagnostic coverage? The formal definition of diagnostic coverage is: [%]= DDDDCλλ Where: = Dλ The fraction of the SRP/CS total failure rate which leads to a dangerous system failure, e.g. the loss of the safety function ( dangerous failure rate ); and = DDλ The fraction of the SRP/CS total danger ous failure rate which is detected (AND handled) by automatic and self monitoring mechanisms that are",

When a fault is detected, the monitoring mechan isms shall handle the fault by initiate an appropriate action which is a pplication dependent. For many applications within the machinery sector such an appropriate action is to initiate a so called safe-state (i.e. the safety-function is performed). The term safe-state implies that the control system removes the hazard instantly (e.g. by immediately st opping/preventing hazardous movement of a part of a machine by remove the power to a motor). For other machines or applications other actions may be more appropriate, such as issuing an alarm. Unfortunately ISO 13849 does not define the term sa fe-state (at all) but refers to this term anyway at several locations. In IEC 61508:2010, Part 4, Clause 3.1.13 the term “safe-state” is defined as: safe state state of the EUC when safety is achieved NOTE In going from a potentially hazardous condition to t he final safe state, the EUC may have to go through a number of intermediate safe states. For some situati ons a safe state exists onl y so long as the EUC is continuously controlled. Such continuous control ma y be for a short or an indefinite period of time. Note: EUC = Equipment Under Control (i.e. the machine) With regard of this definition the following general conclusions of the term “safe-state” can be made: 49 - There is no pre-defined/standardized control system output state which shall be achieved in order to enter safe-state (e.g. all outputs de-energized) - The safe-state can be entered by a controlled sequence - The",

One example where trimming of the diagnostic test technique is when applying cross monitoring of the feed-back signals from two redundant electromechanical components. Even if the components are identical they will have different response times (so called discrepancy times). Therefore the control syst em must tolerate a certain time deviation between the feedback signals. The length of th e maximum allowed time deviation is to be determined in the hazard and risk analys is. A similar reasoning is applied when measuring analog values etc. Examples of possible (non-exhaustive) interp retations of the implementation of some diagnostic techniques is presented in Appendix B in this report. 51 7 Common cause failure In machinery applications where the need of a high degree of safety is needed a common structure of the control system is a redundant architecture. The redundant structure is efficient to control random failures occurri ng in only one of the redundant channels. But common cause failures (CCF) can affect both channels in a negative way. Examples of CCF are short circuits, extreme temperatures and electromagnetic interference. M Figure 14 A single common caus e failure affects two channels In order to prevent that a common cause failure can affect safety the aim is to reduce the probability for common cause failures. During the design phase of a SRP/CS it is possible to implemented measures in order to reduce the probability for common cause failures.

The proposed procedure is described in an informative part of the standard. Other procedures can be used to judge measures against CCF, but the proposed score table F.1 is commonly applied. The sco re table covers the following areas: • Separation/ Segregation of signal cables and also creepage distances on printed- circuit boards The intention is to avoid short circuits between the redundant channels. It is usually very important when static input and output signals are used. The need for separation may be reconsidered when dynamic signals are used. • Diversity in technologies, design or physical principles The intention is to reduce the probability of a fault affecting both channels. An example is different sensitivity to el ectromagnetic interference in different components, e.g. an electromechanical or an electronic sensor. Another example is when diversity in software is app lied to reduce the risk of a programming mistakes affecting both channels. • Design/application/experience The intention is to reduce the probability of an external factor affecting both channels at the same time.

The next step after the category is decided is to decide which diagnostic coverage that is reached for the SRP/CS. Table 6 from the standard has defined four different levels 63 More information about diagnostic coverage can be found in Chapter 6 in this report. The last step after the category and diagnostic coverage is chosen is to decide the MTTFd reached for the SRP/CS. Below Table 5 from the standard has defined three different levels. When applying Figure 5 in the standard it is important to be careful when the MTTFd level is chosen (MTTFd=Low, MTTFd=Medium or MTTFd=High) covers more than one designated architecture (category) and in th is case it will be necessary to go into Annex K and check exactly at which value of MTTFd the PL switches from one level to another. 9.2 Apply Table 7 Table 7 in the standard is similar to Figure 5 in the standard with the difference that it is more conservative, in effect in th ose cases where the c hosen MTTFd value (MTTFd=Low, MTTFd=Medium, MTTFd=High) in Figure 5 covered two PL levels only the",

This gives a conservative approach, but on the other hand it is an very easy method where it will not be necessary to go into Annex K and check the exact limit between different PL levels. 64 9.3 Apply Table 11 In some situations it is not possible to use Fi gure 5 or Table 7 in the standard. This is for instance the situation when you shall combine different SRP/CS with different designated architectures (categories) to a safety function. Below Table 11 in the standard describes how to reach a PL for the safety function. It is important to point out that Table 11 in the standard can only be used for SRP/CS that are connected in serial (in effect no redundant architecture). When using Table 11 in the standard the first step is to identify how many (called N low) SRP/CS that has got the lowest PL, called PL low. As an example if PL low is c and N low is less than or equal to two than the PL reached for the complete safety function will be PL=c. If N low instead had been higher than two the PL reached for the complete safety functions would have been decreased to PL=b. When using Table 11 in the standard it is important to consider the interfaces between these different SRP/CS and check in the safety manuals for each SRP/CS how it shall be connected to other SRP/CS.

EN ISO 13849-1:2008 does only briefly mention management issues and thus this report has thoroughly described the meaning of management of functional safety. The description was based on Figure 3 in the sta ndard, which gives an overview of the complete safety life cycle, from risk assessment to modification of safety systems. An advantage with EN ISO 13849-1:2008 compar ed to EN 954-1:1996 is that it is more flexible concerning how to use categories. In EN 954-1:1996 a direct connection existed between the risk assessment and which cate gory that was required. In EN ISO 13849- 1:2008 the result of the risk assessment is instead that a certain PL r is required for each safety function (and not directly a certa in category) and to reach this PL r it is possible to combine categories, MTTF D and DC avg in different ways. What this means is that in certain cases a lower category can be compensated by using reliable components (high MTTF D) and implement different kinds of diagnostic techniques (high DC avg). This report gives a detailed description of how to interpret the different categories (designated architectures) described in EN ISO 13849-1:2008 together with a practical example. Also the meaning of MTTF D is described both the background theory and also how it can be applied. Another central part of EN ISO 13849-1:2008 is diagnostic coverage. This report describes the meaning of diagnostic coverage and also includes a number of different examples on how to interpret the diagnostic t echniques described in Table E.1 in EN ISO 13849-1:2008.

Finally the report describes a number of differe nt methods to determine the overall PL for the safety functions. 67 Appendix A Safety requirements specification – machinery This appendix presents a template for the safety requirements specification for safety functions intended for machinery applications. A safety function has the following definition: a function of the machine whose failure can result in an immediate increase of the risk (s). Parts of machinery control systems that are assigned to provide safety functions are called safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS). The standard does not give support or requirements on the content of a safety requirements specification for the design of safety functions. Requirements are instead focused on the software safety requirements , the specification of safety functions and details of safety functions. All relevant information for the required f unctionality of the safety functions shall be described and it is important that requirements are described in a way to avoid misunderstandings. The safety requirement s specification is an important document during verification and validation activities. In some cases, the information regarding the machinery may not be possible to get before the design process of the machine is starte d. In this case the safety requirements specification needs to be updated during the design process. The result of the risk analysis for the machin ery is the base for the requirements as well as the intended use for the machinery and e xpected environmental aspects for the machinery. The following is an example of what is needed: • Functional description of the machinery • The work modes of the machinery • The identified safety functions • Functional description of the safety functions • Cycle time of the machinery • Response time of the machinery • Environmental conditions • Interactions",

Currently, there are over 3 million industrial robots operating worldwide, and this number is expected to continue to grow. Despite their numerous benefits, industrial robots present their own set of challenges, especially when it comes to safety issues. These machines are powerful and intelligent, but they can also lead to serious accidents, making it crucial to address the risks, hazards, and safety standards associated with them. By prioritizing safety and adhering to industry standards, we can ensure that the benefits of industrial robotics are realized while minimizing potential hazards and risks. This whitepaper offers an in-depth exploration of the fundamentals of industrial robotics and aims to provide a comprehensive safety guide for addressing hazards and mitigating risks associated with these machines. With the rapid growth of technology, industrial robotics is becoming increasingly popular in the market. These robots are being utilized to automate industrial processes, which is resulting in a significant increase in productivity. Moreover, they are capable of performing various tasks in different industrial settings, which has further boosted their demand. As a result, the robotics industry has seen a positive surge in recent years.A SAFETY GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS HAZARDS By 2027, it is predicted",

    "text": "that the industrial robotics market will reachUSD 30.8 million 2Industrial robots are versatile machines that have revolutionized the industrial sector. These robots are programmable and can execute various tasks in different industrial settings, such as manufacturing, logistics, agriculture, and healthcare. They can perform various operations that are hazardous or require precision, such as welding, painting, and assembly. As the industrial sector requires repetitive and time-consuming tasks, industrial robots offer a cost- effective and efficient solution. Moreover, industrial robots can work in extreme temperatures, high-pressure environments, and hazardous areas where human workers cannot operate safely. The increasing demand for industrial robots has led to technological advancements, resulting in collaborative robots (cobots) that can work alongside human workers. These cobots are designed to share the workspace with humans and can be programmed to assist workers in various tasks, improving safety and productivity.What are Industrial Robots? Industrial robots have also become more accessible to small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) as the cost of industrial robots has decreased, and the installation process has become more straightforward. As a result, SMEs can now adopt automation and enhance their productivity and efficiency. 3 As industrial robots are equipped with sophisticated sensors and better control technologies, they are used for a wide range of applications across different industries. The two main reasons industries have started using robots at a large scale are efficiency and safety.The Exponential Rise in the Use of Industrial Robotics Robots are capable of carrying out tedious and hazardous operations with consistent efficiency 24/7 . These intelligent automated machineries can replace manual processes that otherwise put human lives at risk. Besides, they can also execute tasks in coordination with humans, simplifying industrial operations and maximizing throughput at reduced time and risks.

The virus outbreak universally highlighted the demand for automation and backups. 4 Minimize hazard exposure Human workers operate in difficult conditions in factories. There can be extreme atmospheric conditions like high temperature and pressure or freezing conditions depending upon the operational requirements. However, humans do not have the ability to cope with extreme weather conditions. Besides, as industrial operations expose them to toxic chemicals and fumes, these can adversely affect the workers’ health. Robots, on the contrary, can work in adverse conditions 24/7. Moreover, they can operate in extreme environments with high precision. Thus, workers’ health risks can be eliminated if industries automate risky processes through robots.Industrial robots are designed to undertake human tasks and perform them more efficiently. They have faster processing speed and can handle complex tasks without any errors. These robots have actuators and servo motors that generate tremendous forces for heavy lift operations. They also have vision systems and sensors to help them operate precisely, quickly, and accurately. Here’s how industrial robots improve safety at the industrial workplace setup:Do Industrial Robots Improve Workplace Safety? 5Reducing the risk of injuries Industrial work processes include several routine tasks performed repetitively. Workers often require lifting weights and are under constant muscle stress. These strenuous activities can cause sprains, back pains, and other muscle damage. Besides, even a minor accident, like a collision, can lead to severe injuries. Industrial robots can perform these repetitive tasks without any failure. They have well-designed control mechanisms that help them operate efficiently and carry out strenuous jobs efficiently, limiting the risk of injuries to human workers. Operational safety Industrial robots can help increase awareness of workplace safety. The",

Thus, they can foster a better safety culture and ensure minimal risks of accidents in a factory environment. 6 • Robots have high-speed movements, and it is almost impossible to follow these movement sequences. As different equipment operates in the industries at a time, there are chances of overlapping their radius of actions. • Energy beams like lasers or water jets carry a high reserve of energy, and any asynchronism can cause uncontrolled release. • Robots are programmed machinery. They are sensitive to external errors like electromagnetic compatibility. Moreover, there are chances of software corruption or malfunction, which can lead to unforeseen circumstances. • Mishaps can also result from human errors that can cause issues in the robot’s defined operation.Robots are automatic machines that require little to no human intervention to operate. While there are several technical disciplines that govern industrial robotics, there are still chances of mishaps. Therefore, they cannot be considered completely safe as: Since the 1980s, several notable fatal accidents related to robots have occurred. Typically, accidents do not occur during normal mode operations. The common reasons for accidents resulting from robots include any malfunctioning or breakdown, power failure, control defects, or similar incidents.As per reports , more than half of the robot accidents in Japan resulted from electronic circuit faults. Also, about 20% of issues were due to human faults. Therefore, even if we can govern human behavior, system faults cannot be reduced down to zero.Are Industrial Robots Completely Safe? 7 Since industrial robots have complex mechanisms involved, it is also necessary to follow robotics safety standards to establish a safe working environment for humans.

Besides, when implementing industrial robots, it is also essential to use safeguarding devices. These devices ensure that there are fixed barriers to restrict the work area. OSHA also highlights that awareness devices should be used in the industrial robotics system. These can generate warning signals in the form of flashlights or alarms to alert the workers in case of crossing the safe proximity levels or any other impending hazards. Additionally, OSHA also emphasizes routine inspections and regular maintenance of industrial robots. Any wear and tear or mechanical malfunctions should be detected beforehand. Another important aspect that OSHA outlines is the proper training of those involved in dealing with industrial robots. The workers interacting with these intelligent machines must be fully aware of the safety standards and features.The three primary versions of robot safety standards are from OSHA, ISO, and ANSI.Safety Principles for Industrial Robots 8OSHA standards related to robotics include 1910 Subpart J, which highlights the general environmental controls. The 1910 Subpart O further outlines the machine and machinery guarding. It contains standard definitions of different machine parts and operations. The 1910 Subpart S highlights the electrical work practices, protection, equipment, training, and other aspects. ANSI The American National Standards Institute defines safety standards for robotics systems. It also outlines the guidelines for manufacturing facilities to integrate industrial robots into their operations. These standards are developed along with RIA or",

    "text": "the Robotics Industries Association. The most extensive ANSI standard is ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999 . It elaborates on the guidelines about the manufacturer requirements, installation, protection, and safeguarding practices related to the operation of robots. It also specifies the importance of personnel safety and risk assessment. This version has been updated to ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012 . ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012 has adopted ISO safety regulations. These international guidelines set the global compliance standard for the use of industrial robots. Adhering to these standards assures that the latest safety protocols are followed. ISO The International Organization for Standardization has prepared the international robotics standards that define the safety criteria for robot operations. ISO 10218:2011 highlights the requirements for robots and robot work cells. There are two parts: ISO 10218-1:2011 and ISO 10218-2:2011. ISO 10218-1:2011 defines the requirements for the inherent safe design of industrial robots, protection measures, and other associated information. It also discusses the basic hazards related to robotic systems and how these risks can be adequately reduced or eliminated. ISO 10218-2:2011 is about the safe integration of industrial robot systems. It also describes the design, manufacturing, component devices, and other operational aspects of the system. The standard highlights the requirements that industrial businesses must follow when implementing an integrated manufacturing system. 9 Major industrial robot systems hazards include:Common Industrial Robot Hazards Environmental hazards If the operating conditions affect the robot’s operation in any way, there might be a risk of hazards. Any power failure, lightning discharge, issues in equipment orientation, or potentially hazardous radiation are beyond control. However, these anomalies can affect the robot’s performance and result in abnormal behavior. As a result, workplace safety will be at risk. Operational hazards Any unpredicted or imprecise movement, the unexpected change in the program, component malfunctions, breakdowns, or any maloperation can cause serious hazards like collision,",

    "text": "crushing, and other serious injuries. Installation hazards Poor installation of industrial robots and improper testing measures pose significant risks to the working environment. Also, as workers are first exposed to these systems, they are at increased risk. 10 Power system failures Any disruption in the power system can affect the functioning of industrial robots. Moreover, disruption in the electric signals can also lead to operational failures or malfunctioning of the system at some level. These issues can affect workplace safety and also result in hazardous situations. Control hazards Software malfunctions, radio or electromagnetic interference, or any such controlling errors can affect the functional safety performance of the system, resulting in accidents. These hazards can also result from any faults in the control system, electrical sub-controls, hydraulic faults, and similar issues. Human errors Industrial robots need supervision at some levels and cannot be left alone to perform the tasks all by themselves. Any unpredicted movement or action, incorrect activation of a sub-component, or overlooked critical safety functions can lead to hazards. Sometimes, workers put themselves in a risky position when they make any mistake in the robotics system’s operation, maintenance, or troubleshooting. 11 There are several instances related to industrial robot accidents. In Alabama, a 20-year-old worker was killed due to the abrupt restarting of a robot in an auto parts supplier facility. The assembly line stopped due to some fault. About four workers went in to check the fault in the robot station when the machine crushed the young woman. OSHA investigated this case, cited some serious violations, and imposed a 2.5 million USD fine on the company. The Washington Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (WA FACE) program investigates hazards and performs an in-depth analysis of workplace fatalities. It reported an unfortunate incident involving a driverless forklift that killed a",

As the LGV resumed operation, he was crushed by the elevated forks and was pronounced dead after being rushed to a local hospital.In another case in Ohio, an auto parts manufacturer faced a fine of USD 3.42 million . A 58-year-old worker suffered from an elbow fracture and serious injuries while removing scrap on a robotic press line. Another 22-year-old worker suffered a similar fate while coming in contact with operating machine parts. OSHA found multiple violations upon investigation even after the company assured to improve safety conditions. Thus, a fine was imposed. Notable Industrial Robotics Accidents 12 As per OSHA, it is essential to implement an efficient safeguarding strategy to protect workplaces involving industrial robots. Following are some of the essential steps industrial businesses must take to ensure a safe workplace environment when integrating robots.Safety Considerations for Industrial Robots Safety standards review At the manufacturer level, it is essential to comply with applicable safety regulations and standards when designing robot applications. These guidelines and specifications help create a safe working environment. The sum total of interlinked devices constitutes a robot. Therefore, the entire system must meet safety requirements. Although these standards differ with countries, there are common standards accepted universally, like ISO, ANSI, and OSHA. These governing bodies set international guidelines and also update the standards based on the latest developments. So, manufacturers should stick to certified standards and mention their compliance to ensure that the systems they designed are safe. When buying industrial robots, companies must also review the safety standards of the systems. They must question the robot manufacturer about the specifications and cross-check that the robots can be safely",

There must be ideal participation from employers and workers since they will deal with the system. These assessments can help detect any likelihood of risks and develop protective measures for risk reduction and safety control. Here are some considerations that can help in effective risk assessment: • For risk assessment, choosing an expert in robot applications and process operations is important. Also, employees must be included as they deal directly with industrial robots. • Documentation is an important aspect of risk assessment as the specific guidelines associated with the task can be referred to in the future. The potential risks must be enlisted for each task, and the team can then decide on the risk recursion techniques. • After finalizing the appropriate risk reduction techniques, these principles must be implemented effectively. Also, all employees must be made aware of the risks and how to handle them. • There must be periodical reviews as, with time, the requirements might change. Besides, as the safety guidelines and standards are updated regularly, the risk assessment must include those. Therefore, frequent monitoring and inspections can ensure correct safety functions. • It is also crucial to periodically validate the training manuals, electrical and mechanical drawings, control system safety function settings, sensors, and other safeguarding devices. These can help drive continuous improvements. 14 Risk reduction Risk reduction measures should be decided based on specific robot applications. They should align with the standards hierarchy of controls. External risk control measures will include laser scanners, guards and barriers, and light curtains. Training professionals can handle internal risk reduction measures like built-in safety functions and software settings.

Providing adequate clearance when designing the application layout is also a good practice. Training the workers dealing with these applications and ensuring they know the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) is also necessary. As collaborative robot applications need the involvement of workers, they need specific risk reduction measures based on different tasks. Mostly, they have safety functions integrated into their systems that can control the speed, force, momentum, and positions. Adequate safeguarding Safeguarding devices can help prevent hazards related to restricted space. There are presence-sensing devices, fixed and interlocked barrier guards, and limiting devices that can safeguard workers from accidents. Awareness devices like chain or rope barriers, alarm signals, flashlights, and horns should also be implemented as per the risk level. PPE or Personal Protection Equipment like safety glasses, protective footwear, arc glare shields, and hand protection should be used by workers when operating with the robot applications. Besides, regular inspection and maintenance programs should minimize any malfunctioning or breakdown within the system. 15 The development of smarter and more advanced industrial robots has brought a whole new level of efficiency and productivity to industries across the globe. However, as these machines become more advanced, it is critical to ensure that they are also safe to operate alongside human workers. There is a growing need for modular or collaborative robotic systems that can work in tandem with human workers, which has led to the development of various safety features and protocols. The incorporation of smart solutions that utilize sensors, cameras, and other technologies can help mitigate potential hazards and ensure the overall safety of the system.

New machines - the Machinery Directive From 29 December 2009 the new Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC compels machine manufacturers to meet a minimum set of requirements before a machine may be placed on the market within the EEA. Machines have to comply with the Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs) listed in Annex I of the Directive, thus setting a common minimum level of protection across the EEA (European Economic Area).

It applies to the provision of all work equipment, including mobile and lifting equipment, in all workplaces and work situations. It requires that all equipment is suitable for use, and is inspected and maintained as necessary to ensure that it remains so. The cost of accidents Some of the costs are obvious, such as sick pay for injured employees, whereas some costs are harder to identify. The Health and Safety Executive in UK (HSE) give an example of an accident at a drilling machine that resulted in costs to the business of £45 000 (~51 300 €) (HSE INDG355). However this does not include some of the less obvious costs, and some estimates amount to double that figure. An accident analysed by Schneider Electric Ltd, the outcome of which was a reversible head injury, cost the employer some £90 000 (~102 600 €), of which only £37 000 (~42 200 €) was insurable. The full financial impact can include increase in insurance premiums, lost production, lost customers and even loss of reputation. Some risk reduction measures can actually increase productivity; for example the use of light curtains to protect access points of machines can allow easier access for loading and unloading; zoning of isolation devices can allow parts of a machine to be shut down for maintenance while other parts remain productive. The regulations apply to all employers, the self-employed, and others",

Risk assessment and risk reduction are described in EN ISO 12100. There are various techniques for risk assessment, and none can be said to be “the right way” to perform a risk assessment. The standard specifies some general principles but cannot specify exactly what has to be done in every case. It would seem to be nice if the standard could give a value or ‘score’ for each risk, and then a target value for the maximum value that must not be exceeded, but that is not the case for several reasons. The score that would be allocated to each risk, as well as on the level of risk that can be tolerated, depends on a series of judgements, and will vary with the person doing the judging as well as on the environment. For example the risks that might be reasonable in a factory employing skilled workers might be unacceptable in an environment where members of the public, including children, might be present.

Other factors such as the stability of the machine, noise, vibration, and emission of substances or radiation also need to be considered, as well as burns from hot surfaces, chemicals, or friction due to high speeds. This stage should include all hazards that can be present during the lifecycle of the machinery, including the construction, installation, and disposal. Examples of typical hazards are illustrated below, though this is not an exhaustive list.A more detailed list can be found in EN ISO 12100. Who might be harmed by the identified hazards, and when? Who interacts with the machine, when, and why? Again remember foreseeable misuse including the possibility of use of a machine by untrained persons, and persons who might be present in the workplace; not just machine operators, but cleaners, security staff, visitors, and members of the public.Prioritise the risks according to their seriousness EN ISO 12100 describes this stage as Risk Estimation. This can be done by multiplying the potential harm that can come from the hazard by the exposure",

It is difficult to estimate the potential harm, given the possibility that every accident can lead to a fatality. However usually when there is more than one possible consequence, one will be more likely than the others. All plausible consequences should be considered, not just the worst case. The result of the Risk Assessment process should be a table of the various risks that exist at the machine, together with an indication of the seriousness of each. There is not a single “risk rating” or “risk category” for a machine – each risk must be considered separately. Note that the seriousness can only be estimated – Risk Assessment is not a precise science. Neither is it an end in itself; the purpose of Risk Assessment is to guide Risk Reduction.

Elimination can sometimes be achieved by automation of some tasks such as machine loading. Can the hazard be removed? For example, the use of a non-flammable solvent for cleaning tasks can remove the fire hazard associated with flammable solvents. This stage is known as inherently safe design, and is the only way of reducing a risk to zero. Removing the drive from the end roller of a roller conveyor will reduce the possibility of someone being caught up by the roller. Replacing spoked pulleys with smooth discs can reduce shearing hazards. Avoidance of sharp edges, corners and protusions can help to avoid cuts and bruises. Increasing minimum gaps can help to avoid body parts getting crushed, reducing maximum gaps can eliminate the possibility of body parts entering. Reduced forces, speeds and pressures can reduce the risk of injury.

The elimination of hazards or reduction of risks to a tolerable level, by inherently safe design measures is the first priority. 24 25Safeguarding & complementary protective measures (as per EN ISO 12100 sub clause 6.3) Where inherently safe design is not practicable, the next step is safeguarding. This measure can include, for example, fixed guarding, interlocked guarding, presence sensing to prevent unexpected start-up, etc. Safeguarding should prevent persons from coming into contact with hazards, or reduce hazards to a safe state, before a person can come into contact with them. Guards themselves can be fixed to enclose or distance a hazard, or movable such that they are either self-closing, power-operated or interlocked. Light curtains to detect approach to dangerous areas By finger, hand or body (upto 14mm, upto 30mm and above 30mm resolution) Light curtains are typically used in material handling, packaging, conveyor, warehousing and other applications. They are designed for the protection of persons operating or working in the vicinity of machinery, by the stopping of dangerous movement of parts as soon as one of the light beams is broken. They make it possible to protect personnel whilst allowing free access to machines. The absence of a door or guard reduces the time taken required for loading, inspection or adjustment operations as well as making access easier.

The now common use of complex electronics and software in safety controllers and safety PLCs has, in part, driven the evolution of the standards relating to safety related electrical control systems.Solenoid interlocks to prevent opening of guards During dangerous phases of operation. Unlike non-solenoid interlocks, they are used on loads with high inertia i.e. where the stopping time is long and it is preferable to permit access only when the dangerous movement has stopped.These are often used with either a time delay circuit (where machine stopping time is defined and known) or actual detection of zero speed (where stopping times can vary) to permit access only when safe conditions are met. Interlocking devices should be selected and installed with regard to minimising the possibility of defeat and failure, and the overall safeguard should not unnecessarily impede production tasks. Steps to achieve this include: - devices fastened securely in a (fixed) place and requiring a tool to remove or adjust; - coded devices or systems, e.g. mechanically, electrically, magnetically or optically; - physical obstruction or shielding to prevent access to the interlocking device when the guard is open; - the support for devices shall be sufficiently rigid to maintain correct operation Safeguarding will usually involve the use of some kind of control system, and the Machinery Directive gives various requirements for the performance of the control system.

Instead they are referred to as a “complementary protective measure”. They are provided as a backup for use in an emergency only. They need to be robust, dependable, and available at all positions where it might be necessary to operate them. EN 60204-1 defines the following three categories of stop functions as follows:– Stop category 0: stopping by immediate removal of power to the machine actuators (uncontrolled stop); – Stop category 1: a controlled stop with power available to the machine actuators to achieve the stop and then removal of power when the stop is achieved; – Stop category 2: a controlled stop with power left available to the machine actuators.However stop category 2 is not usually considered suitable for emergency stops.Emergency stops on machinery must be “trigger action”. This means that their design ensures that however slowly the button is pressed, or cable pulled, if the normally-closed contact opens the mechanism must latch. This prevents “teasing”, which can cause dangerous situations. The converse must also be true, i.e. latching must not take place unless the NC contact opens.

Even after some iterations of the risk assessment/risk reduction procedure, it is likely that there will be some residual risks.

Examples include IEC 61508, IEC 62061, IEC 61511, ISO 13849-1, and IEC 61800-5-2 which have all been adopted in Europe and published as ENs. Functional safety is a relatively recent concept that replaces the old ‘Categories’ of behaviour under fault conditions that were defined in EN 954-1, and were often mistakenly described as ‘Safety Categories’. A reminder of the principles of EN 954-1 Users of EN 954-1 will be familiar with the old “risk graph” which many used to design their safety related parts of electrical control circuits to the categories B, 1, 2, 3 or 4. The user was prompted to subjectively assess severity of injury, frequency of exposure and possibility of avoidance in terms of slight to serious, rare to frequent, and possible to virtually impossible, to arrive at a required category for each",

An example often used is “stop the machine when the guard is open”, which really needs more detailed consideration, initially of the functional specification. For example, will the machine be stopped by removing the coil voltage from a contactor, or by ramping-down the speed using a variable speed drive? Is it necessary to lock the guard closed until the dangerous movements have stopped? Will other equipment, upstream or downstream, need to be shut down? How will the opening of the guard be detected? The safety integrity specification must consider both random hardware failures and systematic failures. Systematic failures are those which are related to a specific cause, and can only be avoided by removal of that cause, usually by a modification of the design. In practice, most ‘real-world’ failures are systematic and result from incorrect specification. As part of the normal design processes, this specification should lead to the selection of suitable design measures; for example, heavy and misaligned guards can lead to damaged interlock switches unless shock absorbers and alignment pins are fitted, contactors should be suitably rated and protected against overloads. How often will the guard be opened? What might be the consequences of a failure of the function? What will the ambient conditions (temperature, vibration, humidity, etc) be? In EN 62061, a safety integrity requirement is expressed as a target failure value for the probability of dangerous failure per hour of each Safety related control function (SRCF).

It must include: A specification of the safety requirements for the safety functions (SRCF) that is in two parts: - A description of the functions and interfaces, operating modes, function priorities, frequency of operation, etc. - Specification of the safety integrity requirements for each function, expressed in terms of SIL (Safety Integrity Level). - Table 1 below gives the target maximum failure values for each SIL.Worked example using standard EN 62061 3 >10-8 to <10-7 2 >10-7 to <10-6 1 >10-6 to <10-5Safety integrity level Probability of a dangerous SIL Failure per Hour, PFHD - The structured and documented design process for electrical control systems (SRECS), - The procedures and resources for recording and maintaining appropriate information,- The process for management and modification of the configuration, taking into account organisation and authorised personnel, - The verification and validation plan.The advantage of this approach is that it can offer a calculation method that incorporates all the parameters that can affect the reliability of control systems. The method consists of assigning a SIL to each function, taking into account the following parameters: - The probability of a dangerous failure of the components (PFH D), - The type of architecture (A, B, C or D), i.e.; With or without redundancy, With or without diagnostic features making it possible to control some of the dangerous failures, - Common cause failures (CCF), including; Short-circuits between channels, Overvoltage, Loss of power supply, etc., - The probability of dangerous transmission errors where digital communication is used, - Electromagnetic interference (EMI).

For this example, we will choose architectures B for the contactor outputs and D for the limit switch (See Annex 1 of this Guide for explanation of architectures A, B, C and D). In this architecture, the safety logic module performs self-diagnostics, and also checks the safety limit switches. There are three sub-systems for which the SILCLs (SIL Claim Limits) must be determined: SS1: two safety limit switches in a sub-system with a type D (redundant) architecture; SS2: a SILCL 3 safety logic module (determined from the data, including PFH D, provided by the manufacturer);SS3: two contactors used in accordance with a type B (redundant with no feedback) architecture The calculation takes into account the following parameters:B10: number of operations at which 10% of the population will have failed. C: Duty cycle (number of operations per hour). lD: rate of dangerous failures ( l = x proportion of dangerous failures). b: common cause failure factor: see Annex F of the standard. T1: Proof Test Interval or life time, whichever is smaller, as specified by the manufacturer. The standard states that designers should use a lifetime of 20 years, to avoid the use of an unrealistically short proof test interval being use to improve the SIL calculation. However it recognises that electromechanical components can need replacement when their specified number of operations is reached. Therefore the figure used for T1 can be the manufacturer’s quoted lifetime, or in the case of electromechanical components the B10 D value divided by the rate of operations C. T2: diagnostic test interval.

This explains why no manufacturer should provide an MTTF d figure for an electromechanical device. 54 55The MTTFd for components can be determined from the formula: MTTFd = B10d / (0.1 x nop) Where nop is the mean annual number of operations. B10 is number of operations at which 10% of the population will have failed. B10d is the expected time at which 10% of the population will have failed in a “dangerous” mode. Without specific knowledge of which mode in which a component is being used, and hence what constitutes a dangerous failure, for a limit switch the % of dangerous failure is 20%, therefore B10 d = B10/20% Assuming the machine is used for 8 hours a day, for 220 days per year, with a cycle time of 120 seconds, n op will be 52800 operations per year. Assuming that B10d = B10/20%, the table becomes: Example SRP/CSB10 (operations)B10d MTTFd (years) DC Safety limit switches10 000 000 50 000 000 9469 99% Safety logic module XPSAK154.5 99% Contactors 1 000 000 1 369 863 259 0% The MTTFd figures in bold red have been derived from the application data using the cycle rates and B10d data.

    "text": "A GUIDE TO THE MACHINERY REGULATION (EU) 2023/1230 Key changes and challenges As the “go to” document for machine builders, the European machinery directive lays out the minimum safety requirements for machinery. The last change to the directive was on 29 December 2009, when 2006/42/EC was introduced. In 2020, as part of the commission work program ‘A Europe fit for the Digital Age’, the Machinery Directive underwent an impact assessment, and it was concluded that a number of gaps required addressing – namely (i) tackling new risks originating from emerging technologies; (ii) legal uncertainty on scope definitions; (iii) insufficient provisions for high-risk machines; (iv) adoption of digital documentation; and (vi) divergences in transposition interpretation. As the implementation date draws closer, it is important for OEM/ machine builders to understand the key changes and challenges. What is the impact on OEMs? For OEMs exporting or selling equipment in the EU this will replace the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. It highlights: • A new compliance route • A revised structure to the annexes to improve the flow • Additional requirements added into the essential health and safety requirements • Digital documentation • Cybersecurity requirements 1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1230/ojThe Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/12301 2The Machinery Regulation (EU) PG 2Key Dates PG 3Re-ordering of the annexes PG 4Substantial Modifications PG 9Compliance Route/ Fines & Penalties PG 10OEM - Call to Action PG 11Further Information PG 12 JULY 2026 First report by the member states that assesses the effectiveness of Articles 6(4) and (5) OCTOBER 2026 Member States must notify the European Commission of their penalty rules and measures.Key dates The new Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 was published in the official journal on 29 June 2023, and entered into force on 19 July 2023, with a 42-month transition to the application date of 20 January 2027.

(The U.S. Bureauof Labor Statistics 2005 annual survey data indicat-ed that there were 8,450 non-fatal amputation cases– involving days away from work – for all privateindustry. Approximately forty-four percent (44%) ofall workplace amputations occurred in the manu-facturing sector and the rest occurred across theconstruction, agriculture, wholesale and retail trade,and service industries.) These injuries result fromthe use and care of machines such as saws, press-es, conveyors, and bending, rolling or shapingmachines as well as from powered and non-pow-ered hand tools, forklifts, doors, trash compactorsand during materials handling activities. Anyone responsible for the operation, servicing, and maintenance (also known as use and care) ofmachines (which, for purposes of this publicationincludes equipment) — employers, employees,safety professionals, and industrial hygienists—should read this publication. Primary safeguarding,as used in this publication, includes control meth-ods that protect (e.g., prevent employee contactwith hazardous machine areas) employees frommachine hazards through effective machine guard-ing techniques. In addition, a hazardous energycontrol (lockout/tagout) program needs to comple-ment machine safeguarding methods in order toprotect employees during potentially hazardousservicing and maintenance work activities. This guide can help you, the small business employer, identify and manage common amputa-tion hazards associated with the operation and careof machines. The first two sections of the document,Recognizing Amputation Hazards andControlling Amputation Hazards , look at sources of amputa- tions and how to safeguard machinery and controlemployee exposure to hazardous energy (lockout/tagout) during machine servicing and maintenanceactivities. The section on Specific Machinery Hazards and Safeguarding Methods identifies the hazards and various control methods for machineryassociated with workplace amputations, such as:mechanical power presses, press brakes, convey-ors, printing presses, roll-forming and roll-bendingmachines, shears, food slicers, meat grinders, meat-cutting band saws, drill presses, milling machines,grinding machines, and slitting machines.

Ad-ditionally, while this manual concentrates attentionon concepts and techniques for safeguardingmechanical motion, machines obviously present avariety of other types of energy hazards that cannotbe ignored. For example, pressure system failurecould cause fires and explosions. Machine electri-cal sources also pose electrical hazards that areaddressed by other OSHA standards, such as theelectrical standards contained in Subpart S. Fulldiscussion of these matters is beyond the scope ofthis publication. For compliance assistance purpos-es, references and the appendices are provided onapplicable OSHA standards, additional informationsources, and ways you may obtain OSHA assistance. OSHA Standards Although this guide recommends ways to safeguardand lockout/tagout energy sources associated withmachinery hazards, there are legal requirements inOSHA standards that you need to know about andcomply with.

National Consensus Standards OSHA recognizes the valuable contributions ofnational consensus standards and these voluntarystandards may be used as guidance and recognitionof industry accepted practices. For example, theAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI) pub-lishes numerous voluntary national consensus stan-dards on the safe care and use of specific machinery.These consensus standards provide you with usefulguidance on how to protect your em-ployees frommachine amputation hazards and the controlmeth ods described may assist you in complying with OSHA performance-based standards. Furthermore, OSHA encourages employers to abide by the more current industry consensus stan-dards since those standards are more likely to beabreast of the state of the art than an applicableOSHA standard may be. However, when a consen-sus standard addresses safety considerations, OSHAmay determine that the safety practices described by that consensus standard are less protective thanthe requirement(s) set forth by the pertinent OSHAregulations. OSHA enforcement policy regardingthe use of consensus standards is that a violationof an OSHA standard may be deemed de minimis in nature if the employer complies with a consen-sus standard (that is not incorporated by reference)rather than the OSHA standard in effect and if theemployer’s action clearly provides equal or greateremployee protection.

In some instances, a specific national consensus standard (that is not incorporated by reference or asource standard), such as an ANSI standard for aparticular machine, may be used for guidance pur-poses to assist employers in preventing an opera-tor from having any body part in the machine dan-ger zone during the operating cycle. Also, OSHAmay, in appropriate cases, use these consensusstandards as evidence that machine hazards are rec-ognized and that there are feasible means of cor-recting the hazard. On the other hand, some nation-al consensus standards may sanction practices thatprovide less employee protection than that providedby compliance with the relevant OSHA provisions.In these cases, compliance with the specific consen-sus standard provision would not constitute compli-ance with the relevant OSHA requirement. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the Secretary of Labor has designated certain non-farm jobs as particularly hazardous for employ-ees younger than 18. Generally, these employ-ees are prohibited from operating: • Band saws • Circular saws • Guillotine shears • Punching and shearing machines • Meatpacking or meat-processing machines• Certain power-driven machines: Paper products machines, Woodworking machines, Metalforming machines, and Meat slicers. 6 Occupational Safety and Health Administration Recognizing Amputation Hazards To prevent employee amputations, you and your employees must first be able to recognize",

Hazardous Mechanical Components Three types of mechanical components presentamputation hazards: Point of Operation is the area of the machine where the machine performs work – i.e., mechani-cal actions that occur at the point of operation,such as cutting, shaping, boring, and forming. Power-T ransmission Apparatus is all components of the mechanical system that transmit energy,such as flywheels, pulleys, belts, chains, couplings,connecting rods, spindles, cams, and gears. Other Moving Parts are the parts of the machine that move while the machine is operating, suchas reciprocating, rotating, and transverse mov-ing parts as well as lead mechanisms and auxil-iary parts of the machine.

Here are the basic types of hazardousmechanical motions: Rotating Motion (Figure 1 ) is circular motion such as action generated by rotating collars, couplings,cams, clutches, flywheels, shaft ends, and spin-dles that may grip clothing or otherwise force abody part into a dangerous location. Even smoothsurfaced rotating machine parts can be hazardous.Projections such as screws or burrs on the rotat- ing part increase the hazard potential. Figure 1 Rotating MotionReciprocating Motion (Figure 2 ) is back-and-forth or up-and-down motion that may strike or entrapan employee between a moving part and a fixedobject. Figure 2 Reciprocating Motion T ransversing Motion (Figure 3 ) is motion in a straight, continuous line that may strike or catchan employee in a pinch or shear point created bythe moving part and a fixed object.

    "text": "use and care ofthe machine. A hazard analysis is a technique thatfocuses on the relationship between the employee,the task, the tools, and the environment. Whenevaluating work activities for potential amputationhazards, you need to consider the entire machineoperation production process, the machine modesof operation, individual activities associated withthe operation, servicing and maintenance of themachine, and the potential for injury to employees. The results from the analysis may then be used as a basis to design machine safeguarding and anoverall energy control (lockout/tagout) program.This is likely to result in fewer employee amputa-tions; safer, more effective work methods; reducedworkers’ compensation costs; and increased em-ployee productivity and morale.Controlling Amputation Hazards Safeguarding is essential for protecting employees from needless and preventable injury. A good ruleto remember is: Any machine part, function, or process that may cause injury must be safeguarded. In this booklet, the term primary safeguarding methods refers to machine guarding techniques that are intended to prevent or greatly reduce thechance that an employee will have an amputationinjury. Refer to the OSHA general industry (e.g., Subpart O) and construction (e.g., Subparts I andN) standards for specific guarding requirements.Many of these standards address preventive meth-ods (such as using barrier guards or two-hand trip- ping devices) as primary control measures; while other OSHA standards allow guarding techniques(such as a self-adjustable table saw guard) thatreduce the likelihood of injury. Other less protectivesafeguarding methods (such as safe work methods)that do not satisfactorily protect employees fromthe machine hazard areas are considered second-ary control methods. Machine safeguarding must be supplemented by an effective energy control (lockout/tagout)program that ensures that employees are protectedfrom hazardous energy sources during machineservicing and maintenance work activities.Lockout/tagout plays an essential role in the pre-vention and control of workplace amputations. Interms of controlling amputation hazards, employ-ees are protected from hazardous machine workactivities either by: 1) effective machine",

It is not necessary to lockout/ tagout a m achine if the activity is routine, repetitive and integral to the production operation providedthat you use an alternative control method that affords effective protection from the machine’shazardous energy sources. Safeguarding Machinery The employer is responsible for safeguardingmachines and should consider this need when pur-chasing machinery. Almost all new machinery is SAFEGUARDING EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTING EMPLOYEES FROM AMPUTATIONS 9 available with safeguards installed by the manufac- turer, but used equipment may not be. If machinery has no safeguards, you may be able to purchase safeguards from the originalmachine manufacturer or from an after-marketmanufacturer. You can also build and install thesafeguards in-house. Safeguarding equipmentshould be designed and installed only by technical-ly qualified professionals. If possible, the originalequipment manufacturer should review the safe-guard design to ensure that it will protect employ-ees without interfering with the operation of themachine or creating additional hazards. Regardless of the source of safeguards, the guards and devices used need to be compatiblewith a machine’s operation and designed to ensuresafe operator use. The type of operation, size, andshape of stock, method of feeding, physical layoutof the work area, and production requirements allaffect the selection of safeguards. Also, safeguardsshould be designed with the machine operator inmind as a guarding method that interferes with theoperation of the machine may cause employees tooverride them.

The Performance Criteria for Safeguarding [ANSI B11.19-2003] defines safeguarding as the protec- tion of personnel from hazards by the use ofguards, safeguarding devices awareness devices,safeguarding methods, or safe work procedures.The following ANSI B11.19 definitions describethe various types of safeguarding: Guard: A barrier that prevents exposure to an identified hazard. Safeguarding device: A device that detects or prevents inadvertent access to a hazard. NOTE: The 1990 ANSI B11.19 term Safeguarding device was modified to Safeguarding (Protective) Device in the revised 2003 ANSI standard and the new term includes a detection component. De-vices that detect, but do not prevent employeeexposure to machine hazards are not considered by OSHA to be primary safeguarding methods. Awareness device: A barrier, signal or sign that warns individuals of an impending, approachingor present hazard. Safeguarding method: Safeguarding implement- ed to protect individuals from hazards by thephysical arrangement of distance, holding, open-ings, or positioning of the machine or machineproduction system to ensure that the operatorcannot reach the hazard. Safe work procedures: Formal written instruc- tions developed by the user which describe howa task is to be performed. Primary Safeguarding Methods Two primary methods are used to safeguardmachines: guards and some types of safeguardingdevices. Guards provide physical barriers that pre-vent access to danger areas. Safeguarding deviceseither prevent or detect operator contact with thepoint of operation or stop potentially hazardousmachine motion if any part of an individual’s bodyis within the hazardous portion of the machine.Both types of safeguards need to be properlydesigned, constructed, installed, used and main-tained in good operating condition to ensureemployee protection.

Guards Guards usually are preferable to other controlmethods because they are physical barriers thatenclose dangerous machine parts and preventemployee contact with them. To be effective,guards must be strong and fastened by any securemethod that prevents the guard from being inad-vertently dislodged or removed. Guards typicallyare designed with screws, bolts and lock fastenersand usually a tool is necessary to unfasten and 10 Occupational Safety and Health Administration remove them. Generally, guards are designed not to obstruct the operator’s view or to preventemployees from doing a job. In some cases, guarding may be used as an alternative to lockout/tagout because employeescan safely service or maintain machines with aguard in place. For example, polycarbonate andwire-mesh guards provide greater visibility and canbe used to allow maintenance employees to safelyobserve system components. In other instances,employees may safely access machine areas, with-out locking or tagging out, to perform maintenancework (such as machine cleaning or oiling tasks)because the hazardous machine componentsremain effectively guarded. Guards must not create additional hazards such as pinch points or shear points between guardsand other machine parts. Guard openings shouldbe small enough to prevent employees fromaccessing danger areas. (See Table 1 and Figures 9 through 12 for commonly used machine guards.)

These methods provide alesser degree of employee protection than the pri-mary safeguarding methods and they are consid-ered secondary control measures as they do notprevent employees from placing or having any partof their bodies in the hazardous machine areas. Secondary safeguarding methods are accept- able only when guards or safeguarding devices(that prevent you from being exposed to machinehazards) cannot be installed due to reasons ofinfeasibility. Where it is feasible to use primarysafeguarding methods, secondary safeguardingmethods may supplement these primary controlmeasures; however, these secondary safeguardingmethods must not be used in place of primary safe-guarding methods. Probe Detection and Safety Edge Devices A probe detection device (sometimes referred to asa ring guard ) detects the presence or absence of a person’s hand or finger by encircling all or part ofthe machine hazard area. The ring guard makes you aware of your hand’s entry into a hazardousarea and usually stops or prevents a hazardousmachine cycle or stroke, thereby reducing the likeli-hood of injuring yourself in the point of operation.These types of detection devices are commonlyused on spot welders, riveters, staplers and stack-Figure 14 Restraint Device on a Power Press Figure 15 Presence-Sensing Device on a Power Press Figure 16 T wo-Hand Control 16 Occupational Safety and Health Administration Emergency Stop Press BedControl Box Light Curtain Guarded Foot Control Key Selector Capable of Being Supervised Gate Light Indicator Emergency Stop T op Stop Safe Distance Safeguarding Safeguarding by safe distance (by location) mayinvolve an operator holding and supporting a work-piece with both hands at a predetermined mini-mum safe distance or, if both hands cannot be usedto hold the work-piece at a distance so that theoperator cannot reach the hazard with the freehand.

Automatic and semiautomaticfeeding and ejection methods can also protect theemployee by minimizing or eliminating employeeexposure with potentially hazardous machinerycomponents. An employee places the part in amagazine which is then fed into the point of opera-tion.

Conveyor-related injuries typically involve a employee’s hands or fingers becoming caught innip points or shear points on conveyors and mayoccur in these situations: • Cleaning and maintaining a conveyor, especially when it is still operating. • Reaching into an in-going nip point to remove debris or to free jammed material. • Allowing a cleaning cloth or an employee’s clothing to get caught in the conveyor and pullthe employee’s fingers or hands into the con-veyor. Other conveyor-related hazards include improp- erly guarded gears, sprocket and chain drives, hori-zontal and vertical shafting, belts and pulleys, andpower transmission couplings. Overhead convey-ors warrant special attention because most of theconveyor’s drive train is exposed. Employees havealso been injured or killed while working in areasunderneath conveyors and in areas around lubrica-tion fittings, tension adjusters, and other equipmentwith hazardous energy sources.

    "text": "Roller Figure 30 Slat Co nveyor Safeguarding Con veyors As conveyor hazards vary depending on the appli- cation, employers need to look at each conveyor toevaluate and determine what primary safeguardingmethods and energy control (lockout/tagout)practices are required. Where necessary for the protection of employees, conveyors need to havemechanical guards that protect the employee fromnip points, shear points, and other moving parts,including power-transmission apparatus. Guardsmay include barriers, enclosures, grating, fences, orother obstructions that prevent inadvertent physicalcontact with operating machine components, suchas point of operation areas, belts, gears, sprockets,chains, and other moving parts. A brief descriptionof the hazards and recognized safeguarding meth-ods is presented for common types of conveyors. T ypical Con veyor Hazards and Safeguarding Methods Belt Conveyors Hazards: Belt-conveyor drive mechanisms and conveying mediums are hazardous as are the fol-lowing belt-conveyor areas: 1) conveyor take-upand discharge ends; 2) where the belt or chainenters or exits the in-going nip point; 3) wherethe belt wraps around pulleys; 4) snub rollerswhere the belt changes direction, such as take-ups; 5) where multiple conveyors are adjoined;or 6) on transfers or deflectors used with beltconveyors. Controls: The hazards associated with nip and shear points must be safeguarded. Side guards(spill guards), if properly designed can preventemployee contact with power-transmission com-ponent, in-going nip points and the conveying medium. Secondary safeguarding methods for hazard control include the use of standard railingsor fencing, or safeguarding by distance (location),and installing hazard awareness devices, such aspre-start-up signals and warning signs. Screw Conveyors Hazards: Screw conveyors are troughs with a revolving longitudinal shaft on which a spiral ortwisted plate is designed. In-going nip points, ofturning helical flights for the entire length of thescrew conveyor, exist between the revolvingshaft and trough. Since the trough is not usuallyrequired to be covered for proper operation ofthe conveyor and because many screw convey-ors are located at or",

Controls: A screw conveyor housing must com- pletely enclose the moving elements (screwmechanism, power transmission apparatus) ofthe conveyor, except for the loading and dis-charge points. Permanently affixed grids or poly-carbonate can be installed for visibility purposesto allow the operator to inspect the operation.Alternatively, the trough side walls should behigh enough to prevent employees from reach-ing over and falling into the trough. Opentroughs can be used if covers are not feasible;but employees need to be protected by second-ary safeguarding methods, such as a railing orfence. Feed loading and discharge points can usually be guarded by providing enclosures, screening,grating, or some other interruption across theopenings which will allow the passage of thematerial without allowing the entry of a part ofthe employee’s body into the moving part(s). Chain Conveyors Hazards: Nip points occur when a chain contacts a sprocket, such as when a chain runs around asprocket or when the chain is supported by asprocket or when a shoe above the chain pre-cludes the chain from lifting off the sprocket. Nippoints also occur at drives, terminals, take-ups(automatic take-ups may also have shear points),and idlers.

Powered rollerconveyors have the hazard of snagging andpulling objects, including hands, hair, and cloth-ing into the area between the rollers and the sta-tionary components of the conveyor. In-goingnip points generally exist between the drivechain and sprockets; between belt and carrierrollers; and at terminals, drives, take-ups, idlers,and snub rollers. Controls: Roller conveyors need to, where feasi- ble, have permanent barrier guards that can beadjusted as necessary to protect the employeefrom nip and shear points. For example, theunused section of rollers closest to the employ-ees needs to be guarded when transportingsmall items on a roller conveyor that do notrequire the use of the entire roller width.

Printing presses are oftenpart of a larger system that also includes cutting,binding, folding, and finishing equipment. Manymodern printing presses rely on computer controls,and the high speeds of such equipment often re-quire rapid machine adjustments to avoid waste. This section discusses amputation hazards asso- ciated with two common types of printing presses:web-fed and sheet-fed printing press systems.Web-fed printing presses are fed by large continu-ous rolls of substrate such as paper, fabric orplastic; sheet-fed printing presses, as their name implies, are fed by large sheets of substrate. In bothtypes, the substrate typically feeds through a seriesof cylinders containing printing plates and support-ing cylinders moving in the opposite direction.(Figures 31 and 32 illustrate a roll-to-roll offset printing press and a sheet-fed offset printing press.) 30 Occupational Safety and Health Administration• Perform servicing and maintenance under an energy control program in accordance with theControl of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout) , 29 CFR 1910.147, standard.

Safeguarding Printing Presses As with most machinery, you can rely on primarysafeguarding methods to protect employeesagainst injuries when using printing presses. Forexample, some primary safeguarding methodsinclude the following: • Install guards on all mechanical hazard points that are accessible during normal operation --such as accessible in-going nip points betweenrollers and power-transmission apparatus(chains and sprockets). • Safeguard nip point hazards with barrier guards or nip guards. Nip guards need to be designedand installed without creating additional haz-ards. • Install fixed barrier guards, with tamper-proof fasteners, at rollers that do not require operatoraccess. • Properly designed, applied, and maintained safeguarding devices (such as presence-sensingdevices and mats) may also be used to keepyour body out of machine danger areas. How-ever, these control circuit devices are no substi-tute for lockout/tagout. • Use hold-to-run controls (such as inch or re- verse) that protect employees from machinemechanical hazards by either: 1) requiring theuse of both hands for control initiation purpos-es; or 2) are mounted at a safe distance so thatan employee cannot inch or reverse the press SAFEGUARDING EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTING EMPLOYEES FROM AMPUTATIONS 31 and simultaneously access any unguarded dan- ger area or otherwise reach into the danger zonewhile the press is operating.

Figure 33 Roll-Forming Machine Figure 34 In-Feed Area of a Roll-Forming Machine SAFEGUARDING EQUIPMENT AND PROTECTING EMPLOYEES FROM AMPUTATIONS 33The most common type of amputation hazard associated with roll-forming and roll-bendingmachines are point of operation hazards created byin-running nip points. Amputations occur when thehands of the operator feeding material through therolls get caught and are then pulled into the pointof operation. Causes of amputations related to roll-forming and roll-bending machines can occur fromthe following: • Having an unguarded or inadequately guarded point of operation; • Locating the operator control station too close to the process; • Activating the machine inadvertently; and • Performing cleaning, clearing, changing, or inspecting tasks while the machine is operatingor is not properly locked or tagged out. Case History #10 While feeding a metal sheet into a roller, anemployee caught his right hand in the roller andamputated one finger. Case History #11 An employee wearing gloves caught his lefthand in a roll-forming machine, resulting in par-tial amputation of two fingers. The employeewas standing close to the moving rollers, feedingflat steel sheet from behind and catching it onthe front side. There was no point of operationguard on the front roller and the foot operatingpedal was very close to the machine. Safeguarding Roll-Forming and Roll- Bending Machines Roll-forming and roll-bending machines are avail- able in a wide variety of sizes and designs, andsafeguarding methods must be tailored for eachmachine. Several factors affect the ways to safe-guard the equipment, including whether a machinehas a brake system, its size, operating speed, thick-ness of product, length of production runs, requiredproduction accuracy, sheet feeding methods, andpart removal methods. Depending on the size andtype of machine, a number of different primarysafeguarding methods may",

Some foot con-trols use dead-man (hold-to-run) features so that Hazards of Shearing Machines Mechanical power shears contain a ram for their shearing action. The ram moves a non-rotaryblade at a constant rate past the edge of a fixedblade. Shears may be mechanically, hydraulically,hydra-mechanically, pneumatically, or manuallypowered and are used to perform numerous func-tions such as squaring, cropping, and cutting tolength. In the basic shear operation, stock is fed into the point of operation between two blades. A hold-down may then be activated that applies pressureto the stock to prevent movement. One completecycle consists of a downward stroke of the topblade until it passes the lower fixed blade followedby an upward stroke to the starting position. (SeeFigures 35 and 36 for examples of alligator and power squaring shears.) Figure 35 Hydraulic Alligator Shear Figure 36 Power Squaring ShearShears can be categorized as stand-alone manu- al shears, stand-alone automatic shears, andprocess-line shears. Stand-alone manual shears. An operator controls them from a control station. The operator feedsthe shear either by hand or by activating theautomatic loading mechanism and activates theequipment using hand or foot controls or a trip-ping device on the back side of the shear. Anexample is an alligator shear. Stand-alone automatic shears. These feed and stroke automatically and continuously. The oper-ator uses hand-activated or foot-activated con-trols to initiate the operation, which requires lim-ited additional operator interaction. An exampleis a guillotine shear. Process-line shears. These are integrated into an automated production process and are controlledautomatically as part of the process. Examplesinclude crop shears and cut-to-length shears. The two primary point-of-operation hazards on shears are the shear blade and the material hold-downs.

Here are some primary safeguarding options for protecting employees from the shear’s point ofoperation during feeding activities at the front ofthe machine: • Install a properly applied fixed or adjustable point of operation guard at the in-feed of theshearing machine to prevent operator contactwith the shear’s point of operation as well asthe pinch point of the hold- down. The guard’s design must prevent the employee from reach-ing under or around it. • Install and arrange two-hand trips and controls so that the operator must use both hands to ini-tiate the shear cycle. Two-hand trips and con-trols need to be designed so that they cannot bedefeated easily. The Safety Requirements forShears (ANSI B11.4-2003) standard recommendsthe installation of additional safeguarding whentwo-hand controls are used on part-revolutionshears, based on the nature of the shearingoperation. This national consensus standardspecifies the use of guards on full-revolutionshears. • Use a properly applied presence-sensing device, such as a light curtain, on shears that are hydraulically powered or equipped with apart-revolution clutch. 36 Occupational Safety and Health Administration• Mount guarded foot-pedal controls at a safe dis- tance (single control safeguarding devices) awayfrom the point of operation to protect the opera-tor during the operating cycle. • Use pull-backs or restraints for stand-alone manual shears when other guarding methodsare not feasible or do not adequately protectemployees. (These devices may not be appro-priate if the job requires employees’ mobility.) • Use automatic-feeding devices such as convey- ors with stand-alone manual shears when thematerial is uniform in size and shape. • Equip mechanical shears with either a part-revo- lution or full-revolution clutch.

Theblade runs on two pulleys (driver and idler) andpasses through a hole in the work table where theoperator feeds the stock. Blades are available withvarious teeth sizes, and the saws usually haveadjustable blade speeds. Unlike band saws used in other industries, meat-cutting band saws are usually constructed ofstainless steel for sanitary purposes and for easycleaning. The table, which may slide or roll, has apushing guard installed to protect the operatorwhile feeding the saw.

A basic drill press operation consists ofselecting an appropriate drill bit, tightening the bitin the chuck, setting the drill depth, placing thematerial on the drill press bed, securing the work to the bed so that it will not rotate during drilling,turning the drill press on, and pulling the drill presslever down so that the drill bit will be lowered intothe stock. (See Figure 40 .) Figure 40 Drill Press with a T ransparent Drill Shield Amputations typically occur when the operator’s gloves, loose-fitting clothing, or jewelry becomeentangled in the rotating drill bit. Here are someother causes of drill press-related amputations: • Inadequately guarding points of operation or power-transmission (such as belt and pulleys)devices; • Removing a part from a drill press while wear- ing gloves; • Making adjustments to the drill press, such as setting the depth, securing the material to thedrill press bed, and repositioning the wood ormetal, while the drill bit is still rotating; • Changing the drill bit with the operating control unprotected so that a falling object or otherwisebumping the switch can accidentally start up thepress spindle and tool assembly; • Performing servicing and maintenance activities, such as changing pulleys and belts, without de-energizing and locking/taging out the drill press.

Safeguarding and Other Controls for Drill Presses For drill presses, you must be protected from the rotating chuck and swarf that is produced by thedrill bit. Guarding at the point-of-operation is diffi-cult because of the nature of the drilling press. Thefollowing primary safeguarding methods can beinstalled to guard the operator and other employ-ees from rotating parts, flying chips, and cuttings: • Specifically designed shields can be attached to the quill and used to guard this area. For exam-ple, telescopic shielding that retracts as the drillbit contacts the piece or a more universal-typeshield can be applied. • Automatic machines and high-production ma- chines could have enclosures designed andinstalled to guard the employee from the entiredrilling operation. • Install guarding over the motor, belts, and pul- leys. • Install an adjustable guard to cover the unused portion of the bit and chuck above the materialbeing worked. The following are some secondary safeguarding methods, work practices, and complementaryequipment that may be used to supplement pri-mary safeguarding or alone or in combinationwhen primary safeguarding methods are not feasi-ble: • Automatic machines and high-production machines could use barricades to separate theemployee from the entire drilling operation. • Develop and implement safe work (operating) practices, such as removing the chuck immedi-ately after each use, for drill press operationsand conduct periodic inspections to ensure com-pliance. • Train and supervise all operators until they can work safely on their own. • Use the drill press only for its intended purposes. 42 Occupational Safety and Health Administration• Instruct employees not to wear gloves, jewelry, or loose-fitting clothing while operating a drillpress and to",

An overall commitment to workplace safety andhealth can add value to your business, to your work-place, and to your life. Safety and Health Program Management Guidelines Effective management of employee safety and health protection is a decisive factor in reducing the extentand severity of work-related injuries and illnesses andtheir related costs. In fact, an effective safety andhealth program forms the basis of good employeeprotection and can save time and money (about $4for every dollar spent) and increase productivity and reduce employee injuries, illnesses, and related work-ers’ compensation costs. To assist employers and employees in developing effective safety and health programs, OSHA pub-lished recommended Safety and Health ProgramManagement Guidelines (54 Federal Register (16):3904-3916, January 26, 1989). These voluntary guide-lines can be applied to all places of employment cov-ered by OSHA. The guidelines identify four general elements criti- cal to the development of a successful safety andhealth management system: • Management leadership and employee involvement, • Worksite analysis, • Hazard prevention and control, and • Safety and health training. The guidelines recommend specific",

State Programs The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) encourages states to develop and operate theirown job safety and health plans. OSHA approves andmonitors these plans. Twenty-four states, Puerto Ricoand the Virgin Islands currently operate approvedstate plans: 22 cover both private and public (stateand local government) employment; Connecticut,New Jersey, New York and the Virgin Islands coverthe public sector only. States and territories with theirown OSHA-approved occupational safety and healthplans must adopt standards identical to, or at least aseffective as, the Federal OSHA standards.Consultation Services Consultation assistance is available on request to employers who want help in establishing and main-taining a safe and healthful workplace. Largely fundedby OSHA, the service is provided at no cost to theemployer. Primarily developed for smaller employerswith more hazardous operations, the consultationservice is delivered by state governments employingprofessional safety and health consultants. Compre- hensive assistance includes an appraisal of all mech-anical systems, work practices, and occupational safe-ty and health hazards of the workplace and all aspectsof the employer’s present job safety and health pro-gram. In addition, the service offers assistance toemployers in developing and implementing an effec-tive safety and health program. No penalties are pro-posed or citations issued for hazards identified by theconsultant. OSHA provides consultation assistance tothe employer with the assurance that his or her nameand firm and any information about the workplace willnot be routinely reported to OSHA enforcement staff. Under the consultation program, certain exemplary employers may request participation in OSHA’s Safetyand Health Achievement Recognition Program(SHARP). Eligibility for participation in SHARP in-cludes receiving a comprehensive consultation visit,demonstrating exemplary achievements in workplacesafety and health by abating all identified hazards, anddeveloping an excellent safety and health program.

For more information concerning consul-tation assistance, see OSHA’s website atwww.osha.gov. Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) Voluntary Protection Programs and on-site consulta- tion services, when coupled with an effective en-forcement program, expand employee protection tohelp meet the goals of the OSH Act. The VPPs moti-vate others to achieve excellent safety and healthresults in the same outstanding way as they estab-lish a cooperative relationship between employers,employees, and OSHA. For additional information on VPP and how to apply, contact the OSHA regional offices listed at theend of this publication. Strategic Partnership Program OSHA’s Strategic Partnership Program, the newest member of OSHA’s cooperative programs, helpsencourage, assist, and recognize the efforts of part-ners to eliminate serious workplace hazards andachieve a high level of employee safety and health.Whereas OSHA’s Consultation Program and VPP entail 50 Occupational Safety and Health Administrationone-on-one relationships between OSHA and individ- ual worksites, most strategic partnerships seek tohave a broader impact by building cooperative rela-tionships with groups of employers and employees.These partnerships are voluntary, cooperative relation-ships between OSHA, employers, employee represen-tatives, and others (e.g., trade unions, trade and pro-fessional associations, universities, and other govern-ment agencies). For more information on this and other coopera- tive programs, contact your nearest OSHA office, orvisit OSHA’s website at www.osha.gov. Alliance Program The Alliance Program enables organizations commit- ted to workplace safety and health to collaborate withOSHA to prevent injuries and illnesses in the work-place. OSHA and the Alliance participants worktogether to reach out to, educate, and lead thenation’s employers and their employees in improvingand advancing workplace safety and health. Groups that can form an Alliance with OSHA include employers, labor unions, trade or professionalgroups, educational institutions and governmentagencies.

There are few formal program requirements for Alliances and the agreements do not include anenforcement component. However, OSHA and theparticipating organizations must define, implement,and meet a set of short- and long-term goals that fallinto three categories: training and education; outreachand communication; and promotion of the nationaldialogue on workplace safety and health. OSHA T raining and Education OSHA area offices offer a variety of information serv- ices, such as compliance assistance, technical advice,publications, audiovisual aids and speakers for specialengagements. OSHA’s Training Institute in ArlingtonHeights, IL, provides basic and advanced courses insafety and health for Federal and state complianceofficers, state consultants, Federal agency personnel,and private sector employers, employees, and theirrepresentatives. The OSHA Training Institute also has established OSHA Training Institute Education Centers to addressthe increased demand for its courses from the privatesector and from other federal agencies. These centersare nonprofit colleges, universities, and other organi-zations that have been selected after a competition forparticipation in the program. OSHA also provides funds to nonprofit organiza- tions, through grants, to conduct workplace trainingand education in subjects where OSHA believes thereis a lack of workplace training. Grants are awarded annually. Grant recipients are expected to contribute20 percent of the total grant cost.

Amputation Hazards Associated with OtherEquipment and Activities Although machinery is associated with amputations more frequently than any other source, amputa-tions can result from other sources. This appendixbriefly identifies other equipment and activitiesassociated with amputations: • Powered and Non-Powered Hand T ools. Portable hand tools, such as saws, grinders,shears, and bolt cutters are associated withamputations in the construction, retail trade,and ser vices industries. • Material Handling. Amputations related to manual material handling tasks often resultwhen heavy or sharp objects fall from an elevat-ed surface or shift during transfer. Amputationoften occurs when the employee attempts tolimit the movement of, or damage to, materialas it shifts or falls. • Forklifts. Amputation hazards related to forklift operation and use include employees beingtrapped or pinned between the forklift andanother object; struck or run over by the forklift;struck by falling or shifting loads or overturningforklifts.• Doors and Covers. Amputation hazards are not limited to mechanical equipment or heavyloads. Doors also have the potential to ampu-tate fingers. These injuries typically result whena door closes while a person’s hands are in thedoorjamb. Manhole covers, commercial garbagedisposal covers, and tank or bin covers can alsoamputate fingers and toes. • T rash Compactors. Many businesses use small trash compactors for reducing the volume ofwastes such as cardboard. Often these com-pactors are not properly guarded and employ-ees are not properly trained in their use. Themajority of these amputations result fromemployees being struck by the ram/piston eitherduring the initiating stroke or the return stroke.The ram/piston should be guarded if any part ofan operator’s body is exposed to the dangerarea during the operating cycle. Likewise, beforereaching into any trash compactor the operatorshould de-energize and lock out the machine. Appendix C. OSHA Regional Offices Region I",

This report is an update of BGIA Report 2/2008e of the same name. It describes the essential subject-matter of the standard in its third, revised 2015 edition, and explains its application with reference to numerous examples from the fields of electromechanics, fluidics, electronics and programmable electronics, including control systems employing mixed technologies. The standard is placed in its context of the essential safety requirements of the Machinery Directive, and possible methods for risk assessment are presen - ted. Based upon this information, the report can be used to select the required Performance Level PLr for safety functions in control systems. The Performance Level PL which is actually attained is explained in detail. The requirements for attainment of the relevant Performance Level and its associated Categories, component reliability, levels of diagnostic coverage, software safety and measu - res for the prevention of systematic and common-cause failures are all discussed comprehensively. Background information is also provided on implementation of the requirements in real-case control systems. Numerous example",

This strategy, which gives consideration to the probabilities of failure of components, is en shrined in the IEC 61508 series of basic safety standards and is now established in almost all sectors of industry, inclu - ding machine construction. Not least thanks to the close involvement of experienced experts at the IFA, the authors of EN ISO 13849-1 have succeeded in presenting its con - tent and developing it further such that it remains practi - cal in its application, despite the complexity of the sub - ject-matter. The preceding EN 954 standard with its purely deterministic requirements has finally been re placed. The Performance Level is now firmly established in machine construction.Over the past years, EN ISO 13849-1 has become estab - lished worldwide as the definitive standard for machine controls, and further practical experience with it has been gathered. The IFA‘s experts have commented in publica - tions of their own upon the essential issues concerning application of this standard, and have discussed their opinions on standards committees. The result was the publication in 2015 of the third edition of EN ISO 13849-1. Now is therefore an appropriate time for a revised IFA Report on safety-related machine control systems. The team of authors has revised the entire report and all examples. The changes to the standard have also re ceived particular intention and have been interpreted. The present document is the English version of the report. This report, and the examples of controls that can be imported into SISTEMA, provide all stakeholders with straightforward access to the normative methods that have now become good practice. The report is intended as a tutorial and a reference",

Professor Dr Dietmar Reinert Director of the IFA 10 112 Introduction Since 1 January 1995, all machines placed on the market within the European Economic Area have been required to satisfy the essential requirements of the Machinery Directive [1]. In accordance with Article 2 of this directive, a machine is the assembly of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves, with the appropriate actua - tors, control and power circuits, etc., joined together for a specific application, in particular for the processing, treat - ment, moving or packaging of a material. In the amended 2006/42/EC [2] version of the Machinery Directive, safety components which are independently placed on the mar - ket by manufacturers in order to fulfil a safety function, the failure and/or malfunction of which endangers the safety of persons, and which are not necessary in order for the machinery to function or for which normal compo - nents may be substituted in order for the machinery to function, are also included under the term “machinery” in the sense of the directive. The formal definition of “machi - nery” is also satisfied by interchangeable equipment, certain lifting accessories, chains, ropes and webbing. Detailed explanations of the individual points can be found in the Guide to application of the Machinery Direc - tive 2006/42/EC [2]. The directive now also applies to incomplete machines. The essential requirements of the Machinery Directive for the design and construction of machines and safety com - ponents can be found in Annex I of the directive.

The essential safety requirements applicable to the design of machines and safety components oblige manufacturers to conduct a risk assessment in order to identify any hazards associated with the machine. Three principles are stated, in the following order, by which the accident risks associated with each hazard are to be re duced to an acceptable level: • The elimination or reduction of risks by inherently safe design • The taking of necessary measures for protection in rela - tion to risks that cannot be eliminated • The informing of users of the residual risks, particular training, instruction and personal protective equipment Under Article 7 , the observance of harmonized Euro - pean standards the reference of which is listed in the Official Journal of the European Union (EU) gives rise to a presumption of conformity with the essential health and safety requirements of the Machinery Directive. Several hundred harmonized European standards detail/sup -port the underlying philosophy set out in Annex I of the Machinery Directive for the attainment of occupational safety and health on machines. EN ISO 12100 [3], a Type A standard now comprising a single part only, governs basic concepts and general principles for design for the safety of machinery. Content of the former EN ISO 14121-1 standard – the full procedure for identifying hazards and for risk estimation and risk evaluation of each indivi - dual hazard – has also been incorporated into the new EN ISO 12100 [3] standard. In addition to the standards, the ISO/TR 14121-2:2013 [4] technical report serves as a practical guide to risk assessment, and contains methodi - cal examples.

These standards present a generically applicable system of methods for machine controls and/or their protective devices. The Performance Levels described in the stan - dards extend the concept of Categories familiar from EN 954-1. The safety architectures can now be employed with significantly more flexibility. An essential advan - tage of EN ISO 13849-1 is its treatment of safety-related parts of control systems independently of the techno - logy em ployed, as has already been mentioned. The Performance Level enables different control structures em ploying different technologies to be combined easily. The standard offers everything needed from a single source comprising approximately 100 pages. The methods are formulated neutrally with regard to the specific appli - cation or the technology employed, and are therefore referenced by virtually all product standards for machine safety (generally Type C standards). With entry into force of the revised 2006/42/EC Machinery Directive [2] in December 2009, the harmonized stan - dard acquired greater importance. This can be attributed principally to the new provision that safety-related logic – also described as the safety-related parts of control systems – has been included in Annex IV of the directive. Annex IV products of this kind are subject to special treat - ment under the directive, unless they are manufactured in accordance with harmonized standards the reference of which is listed in the Official Journal. 122 Introduction On the one hand, Annex IV products are not in principle subject to compulsory EC type examination1; they can, for example, be placed on the market",

The presumption of conformity to which the 2008 version gave rise expired on 30 June 2016. The three-year transitional period in which EN 954-1 remained valid in parallel has long expired; users may therefore use this standard, if at all, only by making dated reference to individual subclauses of it.

The purpose of the present revised IFA Report is to describe the application of EN ISO 13849 and in particular its practical implementation with reference to numerous model solutions. Particular attention has been attached to the presentation and interpretation of the new or revised requirements set out in the third edition of EN ISO 13849-1.

The SILs serve as indicators of the level of safety-related reliability. The associated values are target failure measures, each com - prising a decade3. IEC 61508 distinguishes two different applications of safety functions: • Safety functions in low demand mode (max. frequency of demands once per year) • Safety functions in high demand mode or continuous mode In low demand mode, the dimension for the safety is the average probability of a dangerous failure of a safety func - tion at the point in time of the demand: PFDavg. In the high demand or continuous mode of operation, the average probability of a dangerous failure per hour PFHD4 is eva - luated by IEC 62061 (for further information, refer also to [12]). With certain exceptions, only the second definition is relevant in the machinery sector and thus in IEC 62061. The new edition of EN ISO 13849-1 has also adopted this definition of the operating mode, and limits the scope of the standard accordingly. SIL 4 systems with higher risks are unknown in the area of machinery, and are not there - fore considered in IEC 62061 (Figure 3.2, see Page 16). The essential approach of the standards governing func - tional safety (IEC 61508 and IEC 62061) developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), namely that of defining probabilities of failure as the characteris - tic parameter without the specific inclusion of architec - tures, initially appears more universal. The approach of EN ISO 13849-1, however, offers users the facility for developing and evaluating safety functions, ranging from a sensor to an actuator (e.g. a valve), under the umbrella of one standard, even though the functions may involve different technologies.",

The apparent overlap in regulatory scope of the two spheres of standardization initially appears unfavoura - ble to manufacturers of control systems and other users of standards. Both EN ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 are harmonized standards under the Machinery Directive. Parts 1 to 4 of IEC 61508 have the status of basic safety standards from the IEC perspective (with the exception of simple systems); this series of standards cannot however be harmonized under the Machinery Directive, even as a European standard. This situation prompts for example the following questions: • What standard(s) should be applied for compliance with the Machinery Directive? • Where they overlap in their scope, do the standards yield equivalent results? • Are the classification systems of the standards, such as Categories, Performance Level (PL) and Safety Integrity Level (SIL), compatible? • Can devices which have been developed in observance of one of the two standards be employed during imple - mentation of a safety function in accordance with a different standard? For attainment of the greatest possible compatibility with IEC, and if possible to permit merging of the two spheres of standardization in the long term and also to enable the benefits of the probability approach to be exploited without abandonment of the proven Categories, EN ISO 13849-1, as the successor standard to EN 954-1, attempts the balancing-act of uniting both the determini - stic approach of the Categories and the aspect of safety reliability with the definition of the Performance Level (PL) (see also [13]).

They should however be regarded as a key element in simplification of the probabilistic approach implemented in EN ISO 13849, and their application is one of the tenets of this report. The scope of IEC 62061 indicates that it also covers complex, e.g. programmable electronics. Although this is correct, the development of “SRECSs” (see Figure 3.1) employing this technology must nonetheless satisfy the requirements of the standard in accordance with IEC 61508. The scope for the use of SRP/CS developed against the standards originating at IEC is emphasized by the new edition of EN ISO 13849-1. This means that such SRP/CS can be considered equally valid when used for the implementation of safety func - tions under EN ISO 13849-1. Decisive arguments from the point of view of users in the field for selecting EN ISO 13849 as a basis for the imple - mentation of functional safety in the area of machinery may be considered to be the cross-discipline approach with regard to technology, and the simplified approach to quantification with the use of the designated architectu - res. This includes the detailed consideration of non-elec - trical and electromechanical components.

As a sector standard of IEC 61508, IEC 62061 naturally describes the aspect of “management of functional safety” very expli - citly. Development and verification of embedded software to EN ISO 13849-1 is based upon the essential require - ments for safety-related software that are currently stan - dard practice and are also described in IEC 61508. Broad agreement exists however that requirements from the two standards should not be mixed. The ISO/TR 23849 guidance document [14] was developed by members of both standards committees and was published in 2010 by ISO and IEC. Its core messages are: • The methods described by the two standards differ, but can attain a comparable level of risk reduction. • Activities merging the two standards require adequate experience with their application in practice. The IEC proposed merging of the two standards to form an ISO/IEC standard as long ago as 2011, and began work in 2012. The result of an international survey conducted during work on ISO/IEC 17305 showed clearly that the 13849 standards predominated in application among machine manufacturers and end users. As shown in Figure 3.3, EN ISO 13849-1 was used by 90%, i.e. the great majority of the 715 persons surveyed. Development of the planned ISO/IEC 17305 standard was the subject of hea - ted discussion among experts.

    "text": "these protective measures to attain a defined quality in consideration of the risk, an essential step is that of risk assessment, as required by the Machinery Directive and described in EN ISO 12100 [3]. Protective devices are regarded in the sense of EN ISO 13849-1 (safeguards) together with the safe control as the safety- related part of a control system. Together, they execute a safety function; they may for example prevent unexpected start-up when an operator enters a hazard zone. Since a machine can easily have several safety functions (for example for automatic and setup modes), it is important for careful consideration to be given to each individual hazard and the associated safety function. The safety function can be assumed by parts of the machine control system or by components required in addition to it. In both cases, these parts are safety-related parts of control systems. Although the same hardware may well be involved in the performance of different safety functions, the required quality of the risk reduc - tion for each SF may differ. In the standard, the quality of the risk reduction is defined by the term “Performance Level” (PL). The result of the risk assessment determines the level of the PL value required for the safety function. This specification for the design of the control system is de scribed as the “required Performance Level”, PLr. How is the PLr obtained? The risk of a hazard on a machine can be reduced not only by the control system, but also for example by a guard, such as a guard door, or by personal protective equip - ment, such as safety goggles. Once it has been establis - hed what part is to be played by the protective measures provided by the control system, the required Performance Level PLr",

Is the associated injury irreversible (e.g. death, loss of limbs), or reversible (e.g. crushing injuries, which can heal)? Is the operator present in the danger zone frequently and for long periods (e.g. more frequently than once every fifteen minutes), or infrequently and briefly? Is the operator still able to avoid an accident (e.g. owing to slow machine movements)? These three questions determine the PLr. Details can be found in subclause 5.4, examples in Annex A. 4.2 Design and technical implementation of the safety functions Once the requirements upon the safety-related parts of control systems have been defined, they are first designed, and then implemented. Finally, a verification is conducted to ascertain whether the required risk reduction, the target PLr value (block 6 in Figure 4.1), can be attained by means of the planned implementation (blocks 4 and 5 in Figure 4.1) with the actual PL value. The steps of blocks 4 and 5 are described in detail in Chapter 6. Following the tradition of the previous control system reports, Chapter 8 of this report also contains a large number of formulated circuit examples for all control technologies and each Category. In addition, the general descriptions contained in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 are accompanied by a comprehensive description of a circuit example (paper cutting guillotine). This provides the developer with an illustrative explanation of the methods and parameters described below. Safety-related parts of control systems are able to exert their risk-reducing effect only if the safety function was correctly defined from the outset. During the ensuing implementation, quality criteria are applied in the form of the quality of the components employed (lifetime), their interaction (dimensioning), the effectiveness of diagnostics (e.g. self-tests) and the fault",

EN ISO 13849-1 places the methods by which the PL is calculated at the user‘s discretion. Even the highly complex Markov modelling method may there - fore be used, subject to the parameters stated above. The standard, however, describes a much simplified procedure, namely the use of designated architectures with application of a bar chart (see Page 61, Figure 6.10), in which the modelling of the PL is already taken up. Experts interested in the bar chart‘s derivation will find it in Annex G. The Categories continue to be the basis upon which the PL is determined. Their definition remains essentially unchanged since the first edition of the standard; since the second edition however, additional requirements have been imposed upon the component quality and the effectiveness of diagnostics. Adequate measures against common cause failure are required in addition for the Categories 2, 3 and 4 (see Table 4.1). Table 6.2 (Page 50) provides a summary of the Catego - ries. An essential aspect when the proposed simplified calculation method is used is the presentation of the Categories as logical block diagrams, termed “designated architectures”. Since the Categories require analysis of the faults (avoi - dance and control of failures), additional aspects concern the reliability of the individual components, their failure modes, and fault detection by automatic diagnostic measures. Fault lists and safety principles serve here as a basis (see Annex C).

Further explanations of this subject can be found in Annex B. One of the questions most frequently asked regarding the probability of failure concerns the sourcing of reliable failure data for the safety-related components, the MTTFD (mean time to dangerous failure) values. The manufac - turer of the parts or components, i.e. his technical data sheet, should be given preference here over all other sources. Many component manufacturers already provide such data. Even where manufacturers‘ data are not avail- able however, typical example values can be obtained from established databases (such as SN 29500 or IEC/TR 62380). The standard and Annex D of this report also list a number of realistic values obtained from the field, and provide information on modelling in the safety- related block diagram. The effectiveness of diagnostics, in the form of the DCavg value (average diagnostic coverage), can be determined according to the following simple principle: the test meas- ures that monitor the block are compiled for each block. For each of these test measures, one of four typical DC values is determined from a table in the standard. An ave - raging formula, which appears complex but is essentially simple,",

The final parameter, that of the CCF (common cause fai - lure, subclause 6.2.15), is similarly easy to calculate: for this parameter, it is assumed that a cause, such as con -tamination, overtemperature or short circuit, can under certain circumstances give rise to several faults which may for example simultaneously disable both control channels. For control of this source of hazard, it must be demonstrated for Category 2, 3 and 4 systems that adequate measures have been taken against CCF. This is achieved by means of a points system for eight typical, for the most part technical counter-measures, with which at least 65 of a possible 100 points must be attained (for details, see Annex F). The random hardware failures, which can be controlled by a good structure and by low probability of failure, are accompanied by the broad field of systematic faults – i.e. faults inherent to the system since its design, such as dimensioning faults, software faults, or logical faults – against which protection is to be provided by meas- ures for fault avoidance and control. The software faults account for a large proportion of such faults. Since its second edition, the standard has included the requi - rements upon the safety-related software; individual aspects of them have however long been familiar from relevant standards. The actual measures are graded according to the required PL. Further information can be found in subclause 6.1.2 for systematic failures and in subclause 6.3 for software. 4.3 Verification and validation of the control system for each safety function If the design has already reached an advanced stage by the time that the achieved PL is determined, the question arises as to",

For this purpose, the PL is compared with the required PLr (see Block 6, Figure 4.1). If the PL attained for a safety function is infe - rior to the required PLr, design improvements on a greater or lesser scale are required (such as the use of alternative components with a superior MTTFD), until an adequate PL is ultimately attained. Once this hurdle has been over - come, a series of validation steps are necessary. Part 2 of EN ISO 13849 comes into play at this point. This validation process systematically assures that all functional and performance requirements placed upon the safety-related parts of the control system have been attained (see Block 7 , Figure 4.1). Further details can be found in Chapter 7 . 4.4 Changes arising from the third edition of the standard published in 2015 With Amendment 1, the third edition of the standard was produced from the second. The amended passages primarily serve to improve comprehension and applica - tion. A detailed overview focusing upon the changes was pub lished by the IFA in 2015 [15]. The essential changes include consideration, during specification of the required Performance Level (PLr), of the probability of occurrence of a hazardous event; a new, simplified method for determi - ning the PL for the output part of the safety-related part of the control system (SRP/CS); and a proposal for the hand - ling of requirements for SRESW (safety-related embedded software) when standard components are used.

Since the changes – as described in the preceding subclause – essentially concern additions, updating and improve - ments, however, the transition from the second to the third edition of the standard is not generally critical. As it has done for some time, the IFA is supporting this pro -cess with freely available guides to application. These guides take the form both of explanatory reference with examples, and of the “SISTEMA” free software program (the acronym stands for “Safety Integrity Software Tool for the Evaluation of Machine Applications”), which sup - ports calculation and documentation of PLr and PL (see Annex H). The series of SISTEMA cookbooks, which has been continually extended, is devoted to particular topics that are relevant during application of the standard. These concern not only SISTEMA itself (the SISTEMA libraries, use of network libraries, “Running several instances of SISTEMA in parallel”), but also the entire process of design against the standard (“Definition of safety func - tions”, “From the schematic circuit diagram to the Perfor - mance Level”, “When the designated architectures don‘t match”). Finally, the resources include the “Performance Level Calculator”[16] developed by the IFA. This presents the bar chart in the form of a rotating disc by means of which the PFHD and PL can be determined easily and precisely at any time. All further resources and reference – such as information on the test standards and principles [17] of DGUV Test, the test and certification system of the German Social Accident Insurance – can be found on the IFA‘s website at: www.dguv.de/ifa/13849.

The design of such safety functions is part of a process for the design of safe machines. This chapter therefore begins by addressing the requirements of the Machinery Directive, before describing the definition of safety functions and their properties. Subclause 5.7 then demonstrates imple - mentation with reference to the practical example of a paper cutting guillotine control. 5.1 Requirements of the EC Machinery Directive The EC Machinery Directive [2] has been transposed into German law by the German Product Safety Act (ProdSG), and sets out essential health and safety requirements for machines. The general provisions of the Machinery Direc - tive are supported by standards. Particularly significant in this respect is EN ISO 12100 [3], Safety of machinery –General principles for design. The machine designer is presented with a design method that is suitable for achie - ving machine safety. This method – a strategy for risk reduction – includes the design of safety-related parts of control systems1.Provided a harmonized product-specific standard (Type C standard) exists for the machine being designed and the reference of this standard has been published in the Official Journal of the EU [18], it may be assumed that the essential health and safety requirements are satisfied. In such cases, the standard is said to give rise to a “presumption of conformity”, since its application justifies the assumption that the machine satisfies the requirements of the EC Machinery Directive. The strategy for risk reduction must however always be followed where a standard giving rise to the presumption of conformity does not exist, where a suitable standard exists but the",

In order for issues not covered by a product standard to be identified, the first two steps in the risk reduction strategy described below must always be performed, i.e. the limits of the machinery must be defined and the hazards iden - tified. 5.2 Risk reduction strategy The risk reduction strategy presented in EN ISO 12100 [3] was adopted in Figure 1 of EN ISO 13849-1 and supple - mented with the aspects detailed in the latter standard (see Figure 5.1). A risk assessment is first performed. An important point is the assumption during the following steps that no protective measures have as yet been taken on the machine. Ultimately, the entire risk reduction pro - cess serves to determine the type and also the “quality” of the protective measure/safeguard that is to be imple - mented. The risk reduction process begins with definition of the limits of the machine. Besides the space limits and time limits of the machine, attention must be paid in particular to its use limits. Such limits include the intended use of the machine (e.g. materials which may permissibly be machined on it), including all operating modes and the various intervention procedures. Reasonably foreseeable misuse of the machine must also be considered; this includes consideration for the defeating of safeguards. 1 Safety-related parts of control systems are one means by which a safety function is implemented. The starting-point for these systems is the reception of safety-related input signals, for example detection of the position of a guard door by means of a Type 2 position switch, the separate actuator of which is fitted to the door and itself constitutes a safety-related part. Once received, the signals are",

The criteria for adequate risk reduction are specified in EN 12100 [3]: • Have all operating conditions and all intervention pro - cedures been considered? • Have hazards been eliminated by suitable protective measures or the risks reduced to the lowest practicable level? • Has it been ensured that the measures taken do not give rise to new hazards? • Have the users been sufficiently informed and warned concerning the residual risks? • Has it been ensured that the protective measures taken do not adversely affect the operators‘ working condi - tions or the usability of the machine? • Are the protective measures taken compatible with one another? • Has sufficient consideration been given to the conse - quences that can arise from the use in a non-profes- sional/non-industrial context of a machine designed for professional/industrial use?

Priority is however to be given to efforts by which hazards are avoided (inherently safe design), or at least reduced to the greatest possible extent, by design modifications to the machine. In principle, information for use (including organizational measures) is also a possible means of risk reduction. Measures of this kind are acceptable however only in exceptional cases in which an economically rea - sonable risk reduction by means of technical protective measures is not possible; in the majority of cases, safegu - ards will however be required. In this context, safety func -tions are defined that are executed by the SRP/CS (safety- related parts of control systems) (see Figure 5.4). An iterative process for design of the safety-related parts of control systems is set out in [5] (Figure 4.1). Figure 5.5 shows the part relevant to this subclause of the report.

    "text": "to risk reduction 5.3.1 Definition of safety functions The necessary safety functions are defined in considera - tion of both the application and the hazard. For example, if flying debris must be anticipated, a light curtain will be an unsuitable solution, and an arrester (guard) will be required. A safety function is therefore a function by which measures (including measures in the control tech - nology) reduce the risk presented by a particular hazard to an acceptable level. In the absence of relevant provi sions in a Type C standard, the safety functions are de fined by the designer of the machine, e.g.: a) Controlled stopping of the movement and application of the holding brake in the rest position b) Prevention of a crushing point being caused by descending machine parts c) Reduction of the power of a cutting laser where the eye is directly exposed d) Prevention of dropping of the shaft in setup mode e) Evasion of the robot when a person enters its danger zonef) Prevention of entrapment of persons g) Stopping of the closing movement controlled by two- hand operation in the event of intervention in the dan - ger zone by a second person (initiated by means of a light curtain) Compound safety functions are frequently employed, as in the example in subclause 5.7 . The movement is initi - ally braked to a halt by the electronic drive, after which a mechanical holding brake is applied. The two tables below provide information on possible safety functions. Table 5.1 summarizes the safety functions according to subclause 5.1 of EN ISO 13849-1 and adds examples of possible applications. The “emergency stop function” is also included: though not part of a safeguard, it is used for implementation of a complementary protective meas- ure (see subclause 5.5). Table",

The foundation for this is however laid at this stage, with definition of the safety function. By its nature, the technical implementation of a safety func - tion determines the type and scale of the components re quired for it. The definition of the safety function thus has a considerable influence upon determination of the 315 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction safety-related reliability. This will be explained in the fol - lowing examples. Example 1: Safety function “Stopping when the guard door is opened” When the guard door is opened, a machine operator has access to a danger zone in which five drives control the movements of machine parts. Opening the guard door causes all five drives to be brought to a halt as quickly as possible. When the PFHD of the safety function is calculated later, the PFHD values of the following blocks2 are therefore added: • Position monitoring of the guard door, including mecha - nical components • Logic • Drives",

In this case, it is recommended that only the movements actually presen - ting a hazard be considered for the purposes of the safety function, and that the safety function be reformulated in consideration of the drives critical to the operator‘s safety. The associated functional diagram is shown in Figure 5.6. If more than one drive is involved in the hazardous movements in the danger zone under consideration, the hazards are considered overlapping. If the number of drives to be considered is too high, the sum of the PFHD values of the individual drives may once again be a total PFHD that is too high for the required PL of the safety function. The revised standard makes provision for consi - deration of overlapping hazards. Accordingly, the hazards considered in the safety function in question can under certain circumstances be reduced to discrete hazards, i.e. the hazardous machine movements can be reduced to the movements of discrete parts of the machine. Whether this is possible in a given case must be determined during the risk assessment.

For the requirements upon the control system however, only the following dis - tinction is relevant: • S1 – slight (normally reversible injury) • S2 – serious (normally irreversible injury or death) The usual consequences of accidents and the normal healing processes must be taken into account for deter - mining between S1 and S2.

The standard assists decision-making by stating that where operator interven - tions occur more frequently than once every 15 minutes, F2 should be selected. In all other cases, F1 is the cor - rect choice, provided the duration of hazard exposure does not exceed 1/20 of the total operation time of the machine. During evaluation, an average value should be considered for the duration of the hazard exposure in rela - tion to the overall time for which a machine is in use. For a manually charged metalworking press whose ope - rator must reach cyclically between the dies of the press, F2 is clearly the appropriate choice. Conversely, for a machining centre that is set up once each year and then operates automatically, F1 will doubtless be selected.

Conversely, P2 must be selected when higher speeds may rapidly be reached and the operator has no realistic chance of evading an accident. During this evaluation, consideration should be given only to hazard limitation by physically possible means, and not to limi - tation by control components, since the latter could fail in the event of a fault. For example, rollers moving in the direction of the operator‘s hand cannot entrap it under fault-free conditions. In the event of a control-system fault, however, the direction of rotation could be rever - sed, and under worst-case conditions, the hand would be drawn in. A further factor influencing determining of the PLr is the probability of the occurrence of a hazardous event ([3], 5.5.2.3.2). Human behaviour and technical failure may be factors in this context. Both are difficult to estimate nume - rically.

Pressing 2. Manual cutting (single cut) 3. Automatic sequence of cuts (automatic process following the first, manual cut) 4. Knife change In the first three operating modes, movement of the clam - ping bar alone is possible, in order for the line of cut to be indicated. For this purpose, the operator operates a pedal, and is able at the same time to alter the position of the paper stack with his or her hands within the danger zone. 5.7 .2 Identification of the hazards The following mechanical hazards are significant for a paper-cutting guillotine: • G1 – crushing by the clamping bar • G2 – cutting by the knife during the cutting process • G3 – cutting by the knife in the rest position Risk estimation The dynamic press force of the clamping bar (hazard G1) is sufficiently great to cause not only reversible crushing injuries, but also broken bones. For hazard G2, amputa - tion of limbs must be assumed. During manual positio - ning of the paper stack, hazard G3 may lead to injury to the hands or forearms on the stationary knife. These inju - ries are however generally reversible. 365 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction The operators‘ exposure to hazard is very high, since they regularly (cyclically) intervene manually in the danger zone in the course of routine work. The drop speeds of the clamping bar and knife (hazards G1 and G2) are very high, with the result that the operator has virtually no means of avoiding the hazard. When the knife is stationary (hazard G3), the operator is",

The incidence and seve - rity on comparable machines is however low; the safe- guards implemented here are therefore evidently ade - quate. Should the risk analysis for a safety function yield a higher PLr than that actually implemented on the compa - rable machines, the PLr can in principle be reduced by one level. However, since the safety functions on comparable paper-cutting guillotines are achieved with the highest PL, a reduction of the PLr will not be possible in this case (see subclause 5.7 .4). Risk evaluation In consideration of all operating conditions and all possi - bilities for operator intervention, a risk reduction is found to be required. Inherently safe design It is not possible for the dynamic press force of the clam - ping bar and the energy of the knife to be reduced, as this would impair the functionality of the machine. An arrange- ment and design of the machine that would prevent the operator from reaching into the danger zone is also not possible, since this is precisely where the operator must line up the stack of paper. The following measures can however be taken: 1. Shrouding of all points of access to the danger zone except on the operator side. 2. Avoidance of sharp edges and corners. 3. Assurance of a suitable working position and accessi - bility of the controls. 4. Ergonomic design of the machine. 5. Avoidance of electrical hazards. 6.

In this case, SF1, SF3, SF4 and SF6 would be divided up such that dedicated safety functions would be defined separately for the knife and the clam - ping bar.

In addition, testing immediately upon demand of the safety func - tion added as an alternative to testing being at least 100 times as frequent as the demand of the safety function. If the safety function is tested only 25 times as frequently as a demand is made upon it, this can be estimated on the safe side by multiplication of the PFHD with the factor of 1.1. In addition, the requirement for the quality of the test equipment in Category 2 now refers to the MTTFD of the test channel (instead of only of the “TE” block) in relation to the MTTFD of the func - tional channel (instead of only of the “L” block). • “Encapsulated subsystem” introduced in subclauses 6.2.9 and 6.4. 6.1 Introduction Once the precise safety function and its required risk reduction in the form of the PLr have been defined, design proper begins of the safety-related parts of the control system (SRP/CS) that are to carry out the safety function(s).

Finally, subclause 6.4 shows which quantifiable aspects must be considered when SRP/CSs are used in combination. Figure 6.2 explains the need for this additional subclause. The machine control sys - tem (CS) as a whole is divided into safety-related parts (SRP/CS) and the non-safety-related parts; the latter are generally substantially more comprehensive and serve only to perform normal operating functions. The combi - nation of safety-related parts of a control system begins at the point at which safety-related signals are generated (these include, for example, the actuating cam and rol - ler of a position switch), and ends at the outputs of the power control elements (for example including the main contacts of a contactor). Where hazards do not arise in the de-energized state (closed-circuit current principle, de-energization principle), power components such as motors or cylinders are not regarded as an SRP/CS. Should external forces take effect, however (for instance on vertical axes), the power elements must be reenforced for functional safety (e.g. non-return valve on cylinders; supplementary mechanical brakes).

The process of risk reduction in accordance with EN ISO 12100 [3] must be geared to the entire life cycle of a machine, as shown in Figure 6.3. Although EN ISO 13849-1 contains no explicit provision to this effect, the concept of the life cycle must also be taken up during design and integration of one or more SRP/CSs, in order for the activities to be structured appropriately. The description of the standard in Chapter 4 also shows clearly that the iterative process described in the standard for the design of the safety-related parts of control sys - tems is a process subdivided into individual phases. As can be seen in Figure 6.3, the validation phase is charac - terized by structured procedures of its own. These will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 . Structuring into life-cycle phases is characterized very comprehensively by the V model employed during development of safety- related software; this is explained in subclause 6.3. For example, although the maintenance phase is not expli - citly addressed by the design process for the SRP/CS, it is taken into account by the required content of the infor - mation for use. Since an SRP/CS constitutes parts of a machine, requi - rements in virtually any phase of the machine's life cycle may also have an influence upon an SRP/CS. All phases in the machine's life cycle must therefore be considered during identification of the safety functions and defini - tion of their characteristics. In order for this process to be organized as comprehensibly and verifiably as possible, safety functions are first specified. SISTEMA Cookbook 6 [23] addresses this topic",

    "text": "in detail: “Definition of the safety functions: what is important?”. An SRP/CS that is not developed for a specific machine control system – examples include light curtains or safety PLCs – therefore requires a particularly precise description of their charac - teristic data and their interfaces in order for proper use to be assured. The life cycle of the SRP/CS begins with specification of the safety functions. Besides particular aspects of various safety functions, EN ISO 13849-1 also lists general aspects that are a minimum requirement in such a specification. A specification of this kind sets out, at the beginning of the design process, the framework for all parties involved. It constitutes a set of requirements specifications; in no way is it a product specification produced post-develop - ment. A safety function is implemented by the SRP/CS that is part of the machine control system and that pos - sesses interfaces to further SRP/CSs and to the functional control system. A specification must therefore be drawn up. Box 6.1 (Page 43) shows a general arrangement tem - plate for a specification of the safety requirements. The arrangement also includes the specification of the safety functions. This arrangement template refers to the SRP/CS that executes the entire safety function. Where the SRP/CS takes the form of subsystems, the specification must be suitably adapted. 426 Design of safe control systems Figure 6.3: Life cycles of machines and SRP/CS Fault lists (Section 7 .1.3 and Annex C) Identi/f_ication of safety functions (SFs) Specify the characteristics of each SF Determine the required PL (PLr) Implement the SFs, identify the SRP/CS Determine the PL of the SRP/CS from the category, MTTFD, DCavg, CCF So/f_tware and systematic failure Verify: PL = PLr All SFs analysed?

Should however the cause lie in the mains supply, or should the mains disconnecting device (main switch) of the machine have been actuated, these cases lie beyond the scope of quantitative analysis. They can be considered only as systematic failures – and in some cases even as operating states – that must be controlled by the SRP/CS such that the safe state is achieved and/or maintained. Since its third edition, the standard proposes that different safety functions be provided for these scenarios: a) Where power is available b) Where power is not available If it is assumed that power is normally available, assess - ment of the risk parameters for the two safety functions to EN ISO 13849-1 may yield different results. In individual caes, this may – depending upon the actual risk para- meters – enable safety functions to be implemented with a lower PLr in cases where power is not available.

    "text": "Here too, attention must be paid to “sufficient avoidance of contamination of the fluid” and “correct dimensioning and shaping”. Greater resistance to operating movement may neverthe- less arise in fluid power components that are operated infrequently, owing to their design features (gap between the valving element and the enclosure): • On pneumatic valves with soft seals that remain in the same switching position for a longer period, the seals may swell owing to chemical influences caused by the lubricant (oil with additives in the compressed air, int - roduced by the compressor, lubricator, or lubrication for life), or the lubricating film may collapse under the pres - sure of the seal edge, resulting in increased resistance to operation. • On hydraulic valves, silting may occur when the valve remains in the same switching position for a longer period. In this case, fine dirt particles are deposited in the sealing gap between switching cycles, causing the valving element to stick. For these reasons, a high force surplus (e.g. spring force) must generally be engineered for return of the valving ele - ment to the “safety-oriented switching position”. On non- mechanical springs, retention of the reset function must be assured by suitable measures. In addition, the effects described above must be prevented by cyclical switching, to which the standard now refers. Failures caused by the absence of switching are to be prevented by suitable swit - ching cycles/test cycles at intervals for example of less than eight hours. Example 3: Separation of safety-related and non-safety-related functions Standards governing functional safety generally address the separation of safety-related functions from other (non-safety-related) functions.

In such cases, clearly defined functional and technical interfaces must at least be implemented that enable influences upon the safety-related part to be avoi - ded and/or controlled.This requirement is illustrated well by the example of the development of application software. The most far- reaching form of separation between standard applica - tion software and safety-related application software (SRASW, see subclause 6.3) is of course for them to be written with separate programming systems (engineering suites) and run on separate PLCs. For economic reasons in particular, however, it is desirable for the entire applica - tion software to be written by means of a single program - ming system, possibly in the same engineering process. Numerous aspects must however be considered when this approach is followed. These include the requirement that safety-related variables, results or outputs must not be overwritten by non-safety-related parts of software (program, function block, function/instruction, etc.). Links between the two environments are permissible, but only with the observance of specified conventions. One such convention is that safety-related signals and functions must always retain priority: linking by means of an OR operation, for example, is not permitted under any circumstances. Modern software development tools sup - port such approaches, and specified functions and rules with automatic checking have been implemented in their editors and compilers. Errors in logic operations, which may have an effect only in unpredictable operational situ - ations and which may not be detectable with reasonable effort during acceptance/commissioning, can thus be prevented in a user-friendly manner.

This therefore also applies to the interfaces between operators of a machine/ins - tallation and the SRP/CS. These interfaces include both the safeguards themselves, such as a guard door with position switch, and the operation of a safety function, for example by means of pushbuttons or even by a software display interface suitable for this purpose. A machine- determined work rate and monitoring that requires lengthy concentration are also to be avoided. 486 Design of safe control systems The importance of ergonomic principles for the SRP/CS, and the fact that the design of a machine does not always take account of all cases of intended use or foreseeable misuse of the SRP/CS, is demonstrated by the HVBG report on the defeating of protective devices on machi - nery [29]. Resources and further information on the sub - ject of defeating can be found on the www.stop-defeating. org website.

Among the subjects addressed more specifically are: manually operated actuators; keyboards, (keypad) keys and input devices; displays; visual danger signals; and the soft - ware ergonomics of user interfaces.

The main influencing variables that must be considered during this process of determination are stated; the method by which the probability of failure is actually determined from them is however at the user's discretion. Any validated and recognized method can be used for this purpose. Such methods include reliability block diagrams, fault tree analysis, Markov modelling or Petri nets. Depending upon who determines the probability of failure, i.e. the manu - facturer of the control system, the user of the machine, or a test body, preferences for and experience with different methods may differ. For this reason, any suitable method is explicitly permitted in this context.

This simplified method is presented below in detail, both in general terms and with reference to a calculated practical example (see subclause 6.5). Further details on selected specific subjects can be found in the annexes. 6.2.1 Designated architectures... The structure or architecture of a safety-related control system determines its tolerance of faults, and constitutes the framework upon which all other quantifiable aspects are based, by which the PL of the safety-related parts of control systems is ultimately formed. The experience gained by the IFA in conjunction with industry since 1985 confirms that the greater part of all implemented controls can be assigned to a very small number of basic types of safety-related control systems (or to combinations of these basic types, see below). These types are: at one end of the spectrum, the single-channel untested system with components of differing reliability; in the middle of the spectrum, the same type, but enhanced by testing; and at the other end, the two-channel systems featuring high- quality testing. Systems with more than two channels and other “exotic” structures are extremely rare in machine construction, and the simplified method is of only limi - ted use for their assessment. Even where more than two channels are present, however, it is generally sufficient for the two most reliable channels to be considered in order for the PL to be estimated with sufficient precision by means of the simplified method involving designated",

Continuity is assured, fully intentionally, to the Categories set out in EN 954-1, which are established in the machine construction industry and in the associated standards. In accordance with this system, EN 954-1 defines five structures as Categories. EN ISO 13849-1 supplements the former Category definition slightly with quantitative requirements for the component reliability ( MTTFD), the diagnostic coverage of tests ( DCavg) and the resistance to common cause failures (CCF). In addition, it maps the Categories to five basic structural types, termed “desig - nated architectures”. The same Categories may still take different structural forms; the generalization which their mapping to the associated designated architecture repre - sents is still permissible as an approximation within the 496 Design of safe control systems simplified approach, however. The number of “vertical” blocks (input, logic, output) in a channel is for example generally of little relevance to determination of the PL from a mathematical and safety technology perspective. Where more complex safety functions are involved, it may no longer be possible to map the entire safety chain to any single one of the five basic types.

The following information relates to control systems (SRP/CS) that can be assigned to a Category without being broken down into subsystems. It can however be applied by analogy to subsystems that perform only a part of a safety function. 6.2.2 ... and Categories The Categories classify safety-related parts of a control system (SRP/CS) with respect to their resistance to faults and their subsequent behaviour in the fault condition, based upon the reliability of the parts and/or their struc - tural arrangement (see Table 6.2, see Page 50). A higher resistance to faults translates into a greater possible risk reduction. For definition of the probability of failure and of the PL, the Categories therefore form the backbone, complemented by the component reliability ( MTTFD), the tests ( DCavg), and the resistance to common cause failures (CCF). Category B is the basic Category, the requirements of which must also be met in all other Categories. In Catego - ries B and 1, the resistance to faults is attained primarily by the selection and use of suitable components. The safety function may be rendered ineffective by the occur - rence of a fault. Category 1 has a greater resistance to faults than Category B owing to the use of special compo - nents and principles that are well-tried for safety applica - tions.

In addition, the resistance to an accumulation of undetected faults is also assured in Cate - gory 4.

Essen- tially, it can be said that many of the basic and well-tried safety principles are effective not only against random hardware failures, but also against systematic faults that may creep into the product at some point in the product life cycle, e.g. faults arising during product design or modification. 6.2.3 Category B The SRP/CS must be designed, constructed, selected, assembled and combined for the intended application in accordance with the relevant standards with application of the basic safety principles in such a way that they can resist: • The expected operating stresses (e.g. reliability with respect to breaking capacity and frequency) • The influence of the processed material (e.g. aggressive chemical substances, dusts, chips) • Other relevant external influences (e.g. mechanical vibration, electromagnetic interference, interruptions or disturbances in the power supply) With regard to electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), the standard refers to particular requirements stated in the relevant",

The MTTFD of each chan - nel may therefore be low or medium (see below for the definition of “low” and “medium”). Should a component failure occur, it may lead to loss of the safety function. No monitoring measures, including DCavg, are required. Common cause failures are also not relevant on single- channel control systems; no requirements therefore exist with regard to CCF.

Complex electronic components, such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), microprocessors or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) cannot generally be considered as equivalent to “well-tried”.The well-tried property of a component is dependent upon its application, and indicates only that a dangerous failure is improbable. It follows that the anticipated dangerous failure rate is greater than zero, and is considered in the form of the MTTFD during calculation of the PL. Conversely, the assumption of a fault exclusion (see subclause 6.2.10) gives rise to assumption of an “infinitely high” MTTFD that is not considered in the calculation. Owing to the expected higher component reliability, the MTTFD of the single channel in Category 1 must be high; as in Category B, however, no requirements are placed upon the DCavg and CCF. The occurrence of a fault can lead to the loss of the safety function. The MTTFD of the channel in Category 1 is however greater than that in Category B. In consequence, loss of the safety function is less probable, and the maximum PL that can be attained with Category 1 is PL c. The designated architecture for Category 1 is the same as for Category B (see Figure 6.5), since the differences lie in the component reliability and not in the structure. 6.2.5 Category 2 In addition to the requirements for Category B (e.g. the application of basic safety principles), Category 2 SRP/CS must employ well-tried safety principles and be designed such that their safety functions are tested at reasonable intervals, for example by the machine control system.

Each test of the safety function(s) must either: • permit operation, if no faults have been detected, or • should a fault have been detected, generate an output for the initiation of appropriate control action (OTE). As a general rule, and always where PLr = d, the output (OTE) must initiate a safe state that is maintained until the fault has been eliminated. Up to PLr = c, when initia - tion of a safe state is not practicable (for example owing to welding of the contacts of the final switching device), a sufficient alternative may be for the output of the test equipment (OTE) to provide only a warning. 526 Design of safe control systems For the designated architecture of Category 2 (Figure 6.6), calculation of the MTTFD and DCavg considers only the blocks of the functional channel (i.e. I, L and O). When the simplified method in the standard is used, the MTTFD of the blocks of the test channel (i.e. TE and OTE) is consi- dered indirectly, since this method requires the MTTFD of the test channel to be at least half the MTTFD of the func - tional channel.

The test equipment may be integral with or separate from the functional channel (see below for further information). Category 2 cannot be applied in some cases, since testing of the safety functions is not possible on all components. Since the safety function can fail unnoticed between tests, the interval between tests is a critical parameter. In addition, the test equipment could itself fail undetected before the functional channel fails. Simplified quantifica - tion of the PL by means of the designated architecture and the bar chart (Figure 6.10, Page 61) is therefore subject to the following requirements: • The MTTFD value of the test channel is not lower than half the MTTFD value of the functional channel, and • The test rate is at least 100 times the mean demand rate upon the safety function (as an exception, at least 25 times as high; see subclause 6.2.14) or testing is per - formed immediately when a demand is made upon the safety function, and the overall time for detection of the fault and for bringing the machine into a non-hazardous state (the machine is generally stopped) is shorter than the time to reach the hazard (see also EN ISO 13855). Owing to these restrictions and to the fact that with the designated architecture, a DCavg of over 90% is difficult to attain in practice with external test equipment, undetec - ted first faults may result in loss of the safety function.

It thus follows that all components of the functional channel must be tested. The functional channel encompasses all components that can cause failure of the safety function by at least one failure mode. The standard specifies at least a low DCavg for the functional channel. • “Testing of the safety function” cannot always be per - formed by testing of the functional channel from input to output. Ideally, it should be performed actively by the test equipment itself, or the test equipment should use components of its own to monitor execution of the safety function passively.

A purely “logical two-channel arrangement”, for example employing redundant software on single-channel hardware, will however not generally offer single-fault tolerance of hardware failures. 6.2.7 Category 4 Over and beyond the requirements for Category B (e.g. the application of basic safety principles), Category 4 SRP/CS must apply well-tried safety principles and be designed such that: • a single fault does not result in loss of the safety func - tion, and • the single fault is detected at or prior to the next demand of the safety function, for example immedia - tely when the machine is switched on or at the end of a machine operating cycle.

The term 546 Design of safe control systems “blocks” has a defined meaning of its own in this con - text. It refers to function blocks only in the sense that the safety function is executed in smaller units arranged in series and in parallel. The following rules can be stated for mapping of the hardware structure to a safety-related block diagram: • The blocks should map, in abstract form, all control components that relate to performance of the safety function. • If the safety function is performed in multiple redundant channels, they should be presented in separate blocks. This reflects the fact that should one block fail, perfor - mance of the safety function by the blocks of the other channel is not impaired. • Division of the blocks within a channel is somewhat arbitrary; although EN ISO 13849-1 proposes three blocks per channel (input level I, logic level L and output level O), this is primarily in the interests of clarity. Nei- ther the precise boundary between I, L and O, nor the number of blocks in a channel significantly affects the probability of failure calculated in the form of the PL. • The block assignment of each hardware unit relevant to safety must be clearly specified, e.g.",

For Categories 3 and 4, the standard does not set out direct requirements for the reliability of this block; with reference to Category 2, however, a general guideline is that its MTTFD should be at least half that of the individual (symmetrized, see below) channel, and consideration should also be given to systematic failures and CCF. 6.2.9 Safety-related block diagram The safety-related block diagram is based upon the more familiar reliability block diagram [33]. Common to both diagrams is the principle that the (safety) function may continue to be performed provided a chain of blocks that have not failed dangerously remains intact from left to right along the functional connecting lines. However, the safety-related block diagram presents additional test mechanisms, such as the cross monitoring of redundant channels, or tests performed by separate test units.

Should for example a hardware unit in a channel fail dangerously, the entire channel becomes unable to execute the safety function. • A parallel arrangement of blocks or channels symboli - zes the multiply redundant performance of the safety function, or of relevant parts of it. For example, a safety function performed by multiple channels is maintained provided at least one channel has not suffered failure. • Blocks employed for test purposes only, which do not impair performance of the safety function in the diffe - rent channels should they fail, can be presented as a separate test channel.

The fol - lowing points must be observed: • The fault lists constitute a selection only.

This can be determined for example by means of an FMEA. • Secondary faults are evaluated as a single fault together with the initial fault giving rise to them, as are multiple faults with a common cause (CCF, common cause fail- ures). • The simultaneous incidence of two or more faults diffe",

Further information on fault exclusion can be found in Annex C and in Part 2 of EN ISO 13849. Should faults be excluded without the reason for exclusion being imme - diately apparent (such as the peeling-off of tracks on a properly dimensioned circuit-board layout), precise rea- soning must be stated in the technical documentation. Provided the relevant conditions are met, fault exclusions are also possible for components, for example for the electrical break contacts and the mechanical actuation of electromechanical position switches or emergency stop devices. The validity of fault exclusions may be limited here to low PLs; refer for example to Table D.8 of EN ISO 13849-2 and Annex D of the present report. If fault exclusion applies, failure rates ( MTTFD) and monitoring measures ( DC) need not be considered for such compo - nents. 6.2.11 Mean time to dangerous failure – MTTFD The reliability of the individual components from which the control system is constructed makes a decisive con - tribution to its overall reliability. The MTTFD (mean time to dangerous failure) is thus also considered in the PL as a reliability value. It is clear that “failure” in this context refers to component defects that result in the implemen - ted function not or no longer being performed. The other parts of the term require explanation, however: • “Mean” indicates that the value is a statistical mean: it does not refer to a specific component, but is defined as an anticipated value for the mean lifetime of the typi - cal component. In this context, the anticipated value for an individual component can be considered equal to the mean value of a large number of components of the",

This approach employing a mean value is also reflected in the fact that the lifetime values are not normally adap - ted to the conditions of use (e.g. load, temperature, climate), provided the components are employed within the conditions of use specified for them. It is generally assumed here that the higher load in one application of a device is averaged out by a lower load in another application. Should higher loads be anticipated in all applications (e.g. owing to extreme temperatures), how - ever, these conditions must be considered when the MTTFD is determined. • “Time” indicates that the reliability is expressed in terms of a time in the sense of a lifetime. The MTTFD is generally indicated in years (abbreviated “a”). Other forms of notation that may be converted to an MTTFD include failure rates or (switching) cycles. Failure rates are generally indicated by the small Greek letter λ (lambda) and expressed in the unit “FIT” (= 10-9/h, i.e. failures per billion component hours). The relation - ship between λD and MTTFD is expressed, at a constant fail ure rate λD over the lifetime, as MTTFD = 1/λD. The conversion from hours to years must of course be con - sidered. For components that wear primarily as a result of their mechanical operation, the reliability is usually expressed in switching cycles, for example as a B10D value, i.e. the mean number of cycles until 10% of the components fail dangerously. The MTTFD can be calcula - ted in this case by consideration of the mean number of operations per year nop that are anticipated in the appli - cation concerned.

By contrast, safe failu - res may well cause the safe state to be assumed (opera - ting inhibition) or reduce the availability or productivity of a machine, but the safety function is nevertheless executed properly, or the safe state initiated/maintai - ned. In redundant structures, however, the “dangerous” attribute refers to each individual channel. Should a failure in one channel result in the safety function being rendered inoperative, the failure concerned is conside - red dangerous, even where a further channel is still able to perform the safety function successfully. An MTTFD may be stated both for an individual compo - nent, such as a transistor, valve or contactor, and for a block, a channel, or the control system as a whole. This overall MTTFD represents the value for a channel, possibly symmetrized over several channels, and is based upon the MTTFD of all components involved in the SRP/CS. In accordance with the bottom-up principle, the unit under consideration is successively enlarged. In the interests of minimizing effort, it is often advantageous only for safety-related components to be considered in the ana - lysis, i.e. components the failure of which could have an indirect or direct negative influence upon performance of the safety function. For simplification purposes, fault exclusions are possible in addition; these take account of the fact that certain failures are extremely improbable and their contribution to the overall reliability negligibly small. The assumption of fault exclusions is however subject to certain conditions; these are set out in detail in EN ISO 13849-2 and described more comprehensively in subclause 6.2.10.

The manufacturer, and for example his technical data sheet, should be given prefe - rence here over all other sources. Many manufacturers, for example of electromechanical or pneumatic com - ponents, now make such information available. Where data are not available from the manufacturer, typical example values can still be obtained from established databases (see Annex D). Such sources do not generally distinguish between dangerous and safe failures; it can however be assumed as a general approximation that on average, only half of all failures are dangerous. With con - sideration for the problem of obtaining reliability values, EN ISO 13849-1 lists a number of typical values. These are however very conservative estimates, and their use is therefore recommended only if the data sources indica - ted above are not available. In addition to MTTFD values for mechanical, hydraulic and electronic components, the standard also contains B10D values for pneumatic and electromechanical components. Details are described in Annex D. A convenient source of reliability data for components intended for use in safety-oriented control systems are the large number of available SISTEMA libraries (see Annex H). These contain MTTFD or B10D values for elements and components, and PL and PFHD values for entire sub - systems. 6.2.13 FMEA versus the parts count method Once the MTTFD values of all safety-related components have been obtained, certain simple rules can be used to calculate the MTTFD value of the control system from them.

This begins with the small difference between MTTF and MTTFD: what proportion of failures of a certain component are dangerous? All conceivable failure modes can be listed in a complex FMEA, evaluated as either “safe” or “dangerous”, and the fraction of their occur - rence estimated. Since the effects of a component failure upon the block determine whether the failure mode is safe or dangerous, detailed analyses of the effect caused by a failure may be necessary. A greater number of failure modes may then prove to be “safe” than is the case with a simplified assessment, as proposed by EN ISO 13849-1: if the parts count method is used, its conservative approach assumes that overall, the safe and dangerous failures are similar in number. In the absence of more detailed infor - mation, the MTTFD is therefore always assumed with this method to be double the MTTF . Once again, the principle is that of the statistical mean, i.e. an excessively favourable evaluation of one compo - nent is cancelled out by an overly pessimistic evaluation of another. It is quite possible for the parts count method and an FMEA to be combined. Where the values produced by a parts count alone yield a sufficiently low PFH, an FMEA need not be performed. Should this not be the case, however, a study of the failure modes is advantageous, for example by means of a partial FMEA, particularly on the components exhibiting poorer MTTFD values. Further explanations of this subject can be found in Annex B. As with other methods of quantification, evaluation to EN ISO 13849-1 assumes a constant failure rate through- out the",

Early failures are generally disregarded, since components exhibiting pronounced early failure patterns do not satisfy the availability re quirements for a machine control system and are there - fore not generally significant on the market. The advan - tage of this procedure is that the MTTFD is always equal to the reciprocal of the associated dangerous failure rate λD.

Values over 100 years for the mean lifetime are not unusual, but owing to “capping”, do not have any bearing upon the PL above this value, since the maximum value of 100 years (the maximum value in Category 4 is 2,500 years) is substi- tuted in this case for the component reliability. If several channels are involved in a control system, it is not initially clear which value should be employed as representative for the entire system. A cautious approach would of course be to take the lower value; results that are better whilst still being safe are however produced by the following averaging formula (C1 and C2 refer here to the two channels, which are symmetrized): ⎟ ⎠⎞ +− + = MTTFDC21 MTTFDC111MTTFDC2MTTFDC1 32MTTFD⎟ ⎠⎞ (2) Where the channels concerned are balanced, the MTTFD value calculated in this way corresponds to the MTTFD value of one channel.

Effec - tive tests for example permit some compensation to be made for poor reliability of the components. The quality of the tests is measured in EN ISO 13849-1 by the diag - nostic coverage ( DC). The DC is defined as the proportion of detected dangerous failures among all conceivable dangerous failures. The reference quantity may be a com - ponent, a block, or the entire SRP/CS. In the last of these cases, the DC is the average diagnostic coverage DCavg, which has an important function in the simplified quanti - fication of the PL by means of the bar-chart method. As at many other points in the standard, two methods exist for calculation of the DCavg: one more precise but more complex; the other simpler, involving a series of estimations erring on the safe side. The precise, com - plex method involves a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and is based upon the DC definition. In this case, the dangerous detectable (DD) and dangerous undetec - table (DU) failure modes for each component are deter - mined, together with their proportions of the total failure rate of the component.

Application is explained with reference to the example of the control system of a paper-cutting guillotine (see sub - clause 6.5). A number of boundary conditions must be observed for calculation of the DC of a component or block: • Detection of a dangerous failure is only the beginning. In order for the test to be passed, a safe state that pre - sents no further hazard must be initiated in time. This includes an effective shut-off path, which for example in the case of single-channel tested systems (Category 2) entails a requirement for a second shut-off element. This is required in order to initiate and maintain the safe state when the test has detected failure of the nor - mal shut-off element (block “O” on the safety-related block diagram). Only where the risk is low (up to PLr = c) and when initiation of a safe state is not possible (for example owing to welding of the contacts of the final switching device) may it be sufficient in Category 2 for the output of the test equipment (OTE) only to provide a warning. • The initiation of a test, its performance, and the neces - sary shut-off process should ideally be performed automatically by SRP/CS.

Effective implementation of manual tests involves greater involvement in the work process, or greater organizational effort and discipline. Calculation of the DC nonetheless takes account of fault detection when a demand is made upon the safety function, i.e. consideration is not limited to tests initiated automati - cally by programmable electronics; electromechanical components such as relays or contactors constitute classic cases in which the fault of a “failure to drop out” can typically be detected only when a demand is made upon the safety function. Where faults are to be detected in the event of a demand, the frequency must be considered with which a demand is made upon the safety function, in order to ensure an adequate test rate, as described in the next point. • A further aspect is the question of the necessary test rate. A test that is not executed sufficiently frequently may under certain circumstances be overtaken by the incidence of a hazardous event, and may therefore create a false sense of safety. As a rule of thumb, the test rate is always in competition with other frequen - cies; for this reason, a generic adequate frequency can - not be stated. Furthermore, tests have the function of revealing not only random but also systematic failures.

By contrast, down to a factor of 25, the maximum increase in the probability of failure is approximately 10% (refer also to subclause 4 in [32]). Below this level, the synchronization of demand and testing essentially determines whether testing even takes effect. Should, in single-channel tested systems, the test be executed simultaneously with the demand of the safety function and so quickly that the safe state is attained before a hazard arises, no conditions are im posed upon the frequency of testing. (This applies – with reference to the recommendations stated below for the test rate in two-channel systems – provided at least one demand per year can be assumed.) A special example of this is continuous testing (e.g. analogue overvoltage/undervoltage monitoring), for which the requirements for the test rate are always met when the safe state is attained sufficiently swiftly. In two-channel Category 3 and 4 systems, the test rate is in competition with the frequency of incidence of a second dangerous failure, since only if the second channel fails before a test has detected the failure of the first channel does a danger exist of the safety func - tion not being executed. As per the definition, Category 4 systems even tolerate the accumulation of undetected faults. In practice, a range of recommendations exist for the minimum necessary test rate in Categories 3 and 4.

The test should preferably be perfor - med automatically; alternatively, the test interval may be monitored automatically. Only in exceptional cases should it be assured by organizational measures.

Where dangerous failures of the test equip - ment are detected by its cyclical incorporation into the process, deviation from these basic requirements is permissible.

Annex E provides assistance in these issues. • The DCavg formula (4) provides a means of calculation in which blocks with different DC values are grouped in such a way that the minimum DCavg requirements for the attained Category are met even though individual blocks have a DC below 60%, or even no diagnostics at all (DC = 0%). In such cases, it must be determined on a case-by-case basis whether this form of implementa - tion is consistent with the requirements of the Category.

Such failures are related dangerous failures, for example in both channels of a redundant SRP/CS, that are attributable to a common cause. Ex amples include unfavourable environmental conditions or overloads that were not adequately addressed during design of the control system. Should the channels not be adequately separated, dangerous secondary faults may occur that render the intended single-fault tolerance ineffective. The quantitative relevance of these effects in a specific system is difficult to estimate (refer also to Annex F). In Annex D of IEC 61508-6 [37], the “beta-factor” model is used for this purpose. In this model, the rate of common cause failure is placed, as β · λD, in relation to the dangerous failure rate of a channel λD. Without a pre - cise FMEA, β can at best only be estimated for real-case SRP/CS, however. For this purpose, EN ISO 13849-1 con - tains a checklist of eight important counter-measures, for which between 5 and 25 points are awarded: • Physical separation between the signal paths of diffe - rent channels (15 points) • Diversity in the technology, the design or the physical principles of the channels (20 points) • Protection against possible overloading (15 points) • Use of well-tried components (5 points) • Failure mode and effects analysis during development, for the identification of potential common cause fail- ures (5 points) •",

The actual mission time may fall below the assumed 20 years owing to the use of components subject to severe wear (refer to the T10D value in Annex D) or for other reasons. Application of the bar chart is justified in such cases by preventive replacement of the affected components or SRP/CS. This information must be made available to the user in a suitable form, for example in the information for use and by marking on the SRP/CS. Exceeding of the mission time of 20 years from the outset or its extension retrospectively beyond 20 years result in deviations from the bar chart. Annex G shows how this can be addressed. • In the bars for Category 2, it has been assumed that the test rate is adequately high (refer also to sub - clause 6.2.14 and Annex E) and also that the test chan - nel is at least half as reliable as the functional channel. Owing to capping of the MTTFD that can be allowed for each channel to 100 years (2,500 years in the case of Category 4), a high PL can be attained only with certain Categories.

Besides the quantitative aspect of the probability of failure, qualitative aspects must also be considered for attainment of a given PL.

The property of proven-in-use is demonstrated based upon an analysis of experience gained in the field with a specific configura - tion of a component in a specific application.

For this purpose, the standard defines “interconnecting means”, which are regarded as part of the SRP/CS. The term “intercon - necting means” may initially appear strange in the field of electrical or fluid power technology. However, it serves as a generic term for electrical and fluid power lines, and even for such components as mechanical plungers. All requirements of the standard therefore also apply to these forms of “interconnecting means”. In the context of fault consideration, a conductor short circuit for example is an assumed fault. What is the situation however when bus systems are used to transmit safety-related informa - tion? Detailed consideration of such a complex subject is of course outside the scope of the standard, particularly since the subject is already covered by DGUV test prin - ciples (GS-ET-26, [38]) and a standard (IEC 61784-3 [39]).

The model assumes the repetition, loss, insertion, incorrect sequence, corruption and delay of safety-related messages and the coupling of safety- related and non-safety-related messages as possible faults. Further possible aspects include faults that syste - matically corrupt messages, for example by completely inverting them. Measures in “safety layers” that are then implemented in safety-related parts of control systems enable transmission faults to be excluded with sufficient probability. Suitable measures include, for example, the sequence number, timestamp, time expectations, connection authentication, feedback message and data integrity assurance. Data integrity assurance in particular frequently entails complex calculations. The purpose of these calculations is to determine the residual error pro - bability R, and from it the residual error rate Λ (derived from the lower-case λ for the failure rate for components). Exactly this value can then be calculated as the average probability of a dangerous failure per hour required for a PL as a proportion for the transmission of safety-relevant messages. Both of the above publications limit the resi - dual error rate to 1% of the maximum permissible value for the probability of a dangerous failure per hour. Values stated by manufacturers are in fact frequently related to an SIL (see Chapter 3); in practice, however, these values are compatible for use under a required PL (see also Figure 3.2).

For the sake of emphasis at this point: the requirements in subclause 4.6 of the standard enable safety-related software to be developed for all SRP/CS in the machinery sector and for all required Performance Levels from a to e. This subclause is intended in the first instance for application programmers tasked with deve - loping the safety functions for a machine, for example in an application-oriented language on a programmable logic controller (PLC). By contrast, these requirements in EN ISO 13849-1 are not particularly new to developers of SRESW (safety-related embedded software), i.e. firmware or software tools for electronic safety components. Such “embedded software” developments for the components, which are generally certified, are often subject to the very complex requirements of the IEC 61508-3 basic safety standard [42] (and its further seven parts), which is bin - ding for IEC standards governing functional safety.

The descriptions below are therefore limited to a brief presentation of the normative requirements of EN ISO 13849-1 concerning safety-related software. The basic principles of this subclause can be applied to both software types. Individual requirements tend to be formulated in detail more for application programming of SRASW. Conversely, the example described in subclause 6.5 of a control system for a paper-cutting guillotine shows the development of SRESW. The requirements governing software development are geared to the software type (SRASW or SRESW) and the language type. As in other current standards containing requirements for software, a distinction is drawn be tween the language types FVL (full variability language) and LVL (limited variability language). SRASW is generally programmed in LVL, for example in a graphical language as defined in IEC 61131-3. The requirements contained in subclause 4.6.3 of EN ISO 13849-1 apply in this case.

It is therefore all the more important that all reasonable steps be taken to avoid errors during the deve - lopment of safety-related software, the purpose of which is after all that of minimizing risks. What is considered reasonable is determined on the one hand by the required Performance Level PLr. At the same time, safety-critical faults tend to creep into particular phases of software development, where, devastatingly, they remain undetec - ted until they cause a failure in operation. These phases are known to be those of specification, design and modi - fication. The requirements of EN ISO 13849-1 – and the explanations provided in this subclause – are therefore aimed in particular at fault avoidance in these phases. Sadly, less attention is often paid in practice to these pha - ses of application programming. In order for the safety-related software produced to be of high quality, it is clear that suitable up-to-date and well- tried “software engineering” development models should be followed. For safety-related systems, reference is gene - rally made in this context to the “V model” [45]. Since the V model familiar from the reference is generally used for very complex software, EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 4.6.1 requires only a more simplified form of it (Figure 6.11).

In addition, the following are presented: • Functions that detect and control hardware faults • Performance characteristics, such as the maximum response time • Fault-mode responses • Interfaces provided to other systems, etc. Besides these functional requirements, the PL to be attained by the safety functions, the PLr, must be stated, in order to permit selection of the necessary measures for fault avoidance (see further below). This specification (or “safety-related software require - ments specification”) must be verified, for example by a review performed by a person not involved in its creation. The reviewer must confirm firstly that the requirements specification complies with the higher-level specification, and secondly that it satisfies the formal requirements governing how a software specification is to be written. The specification should be structured and generated in detail in such a way that it can also serve as a checklist for later validation. The overall safety of a machine or machinery installation is assured by all safety-related parts of the control system and their functions (components of all technologies, elec - tronics, software). A description is therefore required at this point, in the form of a specification, of the safety for the machine/machinery installation. The document need not run into the hundreds of pages; it is acceptable for it to be limited to the essential points in a comprehensible form.

The other elements involved in assuring safety must be able to rely upon implementation of the functions in the software. The specification is thus also the point of reference for accep - tance of the software: validation of the software functions must demonstrate whether the “contractual obligations” have been met. In the area of SRASW, this must be taken literally, since the engineering and programming of a con - trol system are often assigned by the parties responsible for safety as a whole to other companies or corporate divisions. In this case, the specification also serves as a contractually binding interface to external or internal ser - vice providers. 676 Design of safe control systems 6.3.3 System and module design for the “safety-related technical specification” The software architecture is generally already defined by the operating system or the development tool. The design further defines the structure and modules to be employed for implementation of the specified safety sub-functions. What existing library functions are to be employed must be determined, as must whether new functions may have to be developed specifically for the project.

For less complex SRP/CS, the system and module design can be summarized in a “safety-related software technical specification”. 6.3.4 Finally: programming Coding work proper then begins. In the interests of fault avoidance, the following three aspects must be observed: • Code must be readable and clear, in order to facilitate testing and error-free modification at a later stage. Bin - ding programming guidelines facilitate, among other things, better commenting of the program and the assignment of self-explanatory names to variables and modules. • Defensive programming, i.e. the assumption that inter - nal or external errors may always be present, and detec - tion of them. If the characteristic of input signals over time is known, for example, this anticipatory approach can be used to detect errors in the peripheral circuitry. If a finite-state machine is being programmed, the state variable is monitored for a valid value range, etc. • The code must be analysed statically, i.e. without exe - cution: for low PLs, a code review is sufficient; for PLs d and e, the data and control flow should also be exa - mined, ideally with the use of tools. Typical questions are: is the code consistent with the preceding software design? Do any points exist at which signals with a lower PL (for example from a standard PLC) override a signal with a higher PL? Where and by what modules are variables initialized, written to, and then assigned to the safety output? What software functions are executed conditionally?6.3.5 Module test, integration test and validation In the module test, the new software functions developed specifically for the project are tested and simulated in order to check whether they are coded as specified in the module",

At the integration test at the latest, for example during the typical commissioning of a machine's PLC, the complete software is tested for proper operation on the hardware (integration) and compliance with the system design (verification). Both are still verification measures, i.e. they involve looking “into” the software. Whether the safety-related sub-functions of the software perform as specified is determined by software validation, which has already been described. For the higher PLs d and e, an extended functional test is also required. Individual software functions that have been certified or validated by quality assurance measures do not need to be tested again. As soon as a number of these functions are combined for a specific project, however, the resulting new form of safety sub-function must be validated. Even on certified modules, dangerous systematic failures may be caused by errors in parameterization and logic. 6.3.6 Structure of the normative requirements Once the design process has been outlined, normative requirements are described for the software itself, for the development tools used, and for the development acti - vities. These requirements also contribute towards fault avoidance. The effort involved should be commensurate with the required risk reduction, in the same way as for the hardware of the programmable SRP/CS. The require- ments and their effectiveness are therefore increased intelligently in line with rising PLr. Figure 6.12 shows that a suitable package of basic meas- ures is first set out for all PLs for both SRASW and SRESW. These basic measures can be regarded as software-speci - fic basic safety principles. They are sufficient for the deve - lopment of software for PL a or b. For software employed in SRP/CS for PL c to e, the basic measures are supple - mented by additional measures for fault avoidance. The latter are required",

The aspect of “higher effectiveness” refers to the rising level of fault avoidance. This may be illustrated by the important task of production of the specification. For PL c, for example, it may be sufficient for programmers to write the specification themselves and for it to be reviewed by others (internal review).

More eyes (generally) find more errors. A comprehensive discussion of the individual requirements and of their greater or lesser effectiveness is unfortunately beyond the scope of the present report.

In this case, the requirements for fault avoidance are therefore geared towards the highest PLr (in the example given: e). • Redundant SRP/CS of which only one channel is pro - grammable: although the programmable electronics constitute only a single channel, the overall structure satisfies Category 3 or 4. Safety functions with a hig - her PLr, such as d or e, are frequently implemented by means of these structures. If programmable electronics are employed in one channel of the part of the control system in diverse redundancy with a technology other than programmable electronics (e.g. fluid power tech - nology) in the other channel, the IFA's recommendation is that the normative requirements can be reduced by one PL level, e.g. for PLr c instead of PLr d, owing to the lower probability of a dangerous failure caused by sys -tematic faults in this SRASW. Irrespective of this, the normative requirements for the SRESW must also be observed (subclause 6.3.10). • Use of standard PLCs: the circuit examples in this report (see Chapter 8, Page 99 ff.) demonstrate that standard PLCs can in principle also be used to engineer safety- related control systems.

Should the degree of this diversity be so great that the code, the design, and even the specification have been created differently, this software can also be developed in accordance with the requirements set out in EN ISO 13849-1 for PL d.

The selection and quality of these tools are therefore decisive factors for the avoidance 696 Design of safe control systems of errors and thus for the quality of the safety function. EN ISO 13849-1 emphasizes four elements: • Development tools: Development requires tools that are suitable and well- tried for the intended use. Certified tools for safety com - ponents are generally employed for SRASW. Features such as the avoidance and detection of semantic errors, the observance of language subsets or the monitoring of programming guidelines relieve programmers of tasks and enhance the quality of the software. • Libraries of software functions: The design of the system should consider existing or supplied libraries and, where practicable, employ validated functions.

Even these languages are more comprehensive than necessary, and contain constructs that in some cases are error-prone. Programmers should therefore limit the use of the syntax. Corresponding language subsets are generally specified by the tool. • Programming guidelines: Suitable programming guidelines must be observed for coding of the software functions [47]. The guidelines should be the existing, accepted rules of a recognized organization. Alternatively, a company may draw up sui - table programming guidelines of its own, provided they have a sound practical or theoretical basis.

For safety- related software in particular, it is obvious and therefore a requirement that its development be transparent to all parties involved and for subsequent inspections: • Who performed specification, programming, commis- sioning, verification and validation, and when? • What was used for development, e.g. tools and their settings, re-used functions and their identification, pro - gramming guidelines? • What program versions are loaded on which SRP/CS?

This procedure is termed “modifica - tion”. These changes are often so extensive that not only the code, but even the original specification is no longer appropriate and should in fact be revised.

Since the standard formulates requirements for the implemen - tation of SRESW and SRASW, these must also be satisfied with regard to electronically programmable standard com - ponents. Restrictions exist however that do not apply to tested safety components.

An example employing a standard PLC and a standard fre - quency inverter is shown in Annex I of the standard.

This means that owing to the diversity bet -ween two channels (the difference in the technologies em ployed), the probability of a dangerous failure of the SRP/CS being caused by an error in the SRESW is strongly reduced.

Note : when identical hardware is used, particular atten - tion must be paid to the systematic capability of the components for the required Performance Level. • The two channels employ different hardware (e.g. micro - processors with different processor cores), since it is assumed that the associated embedded software was programmed in different development environments. The requirement for “technological diversity” can nor - mally be regarded as not being satisfied in the following examples:• The two channels employ components of the same kind from different manufacturers, without further informa - tion on the diversity of the embedded software. In this scenario, it cannot normally be ruled out that the two manufacturers use the same embedded software com - ponents, and possibly even identical hardware (brand labelling). • The two channels employ components of different kinds from the same manufacturer, without further informa - tion on the embedded software. Requirements for SRASW The requirements upon SRASW are geared to the PL that must be attained by the subsystem containing the pro - grammable standard component. If for example a stan - dard component is employed in one channel in diverse redundancy with a different technology (e.g. fluid power) in the other channel in Category 3 or 4, the IFA's recom - mendation is that the requirements upon SRASW can be reduced by one PL level (e.g. from PL d to PL c) owing to the lower probability of a dangerous failure caused by systematic errors in the SRASW. This can be inferred from subclause 7 .4.3, “Synthesis of elements to achieve the 726 Design of safe control systems required systematic capability”, of IEC 61508-2 [48]. In the",

Further cases are described in IFA Report 2/2016 [43], Chapter 9. 6.4 Combination of SRP/CSs as subsystems Up to this point, this chapter has considered an SRP/CS only in the form of a complete control system that can be mapped in its entirety to a Category or designated architecture with a corresponding Performance Level. The safety function is executed entirely by such a control system, beginning with an initiating event through to attainment of the safe state. In reality however, it is often necessary for several SRP/CSs, each of which performs parts of the safety function, to be arranged in series as subsystems. Such subsystems may employ different technologies and/or implement different Categories or Performance Levels. Frequently, for example, different technologies are employed on the sensor/logic level (e.g. electronics in Category 3) to those on the drive level (e.g. hydraulics in Category 1), or bought-in devices are inter - linked, e.g. light curtains, electronic controls and pneu - matic valve level as shown in Figure 6.13.

A chain is only ever as strong as its weakest link: this rule also applies to the interlinking of parts of control systems both of different Categories and of different Performance Levels. As has often been observed in practice, a hydrau - lic control system of Category 1 may, owing to the high MTTFD of its components, exhibit a safety level compara - ble to that of a Category 3 electronic control system with a medium DCavg and low MTTFD. Since positive and negative correction values for the Category are already reflected in the PL via the MTTFD and DCavg, the PL for the combination is geared to the lowest PL in the series arrangement, and not to the lowest individual Category. A rising number of control elements and their respective contributions to the PFHD also increases the overall probability of failure PFHD of the system as a whole. Consequently, the PL of the series arrangement can be reduced by a further level from the lowest subsystem PL if for example addition of the PFHD values causes the threshold of the PFHD to the next PL down to be crossed. Values for the average probability of a dangerous failure per hour PFHD are normally available for all subsystems (values for SIL and PFHD to IEC 61508 [10] or IEC 62061 [11] are also suitable).

In other words, each output status of an actuating subsystem that signals the demand of the safety function must be a suitable initiating event for initiating the safe state of the downstream subsystem. In two-channel systems connected in series, addition of the subsystem PFHD values may lead to minor arithmetic errors on the unsafe side. Strictly speaking, the two out - puts of the first subsystem should additionally be read crossed over into the inputs of the second subsystem, and compared. Crossed-over doubling of the input infor - mation, however, is often already implemented internally at the input level of the second subsystem. In order to prevent an unnecessarily high wiring overhead, the minor underestimation of the PFHD during addition is tolerable.

It is therefore recommended that subsystems sharing the same struc - ture be grouped together, as shown in Figure 6.14. This makes calculation of the PL simpler, and unnecessary truncation effects, such as multiple capping of the MTTFD of a channel to 100 years, are avoided. Special cases nevertheless remain for which only rough rules, if any, can be stated at this time. One special case concerns the arrangement of subsystems in parallel. In this case, simple, generic rules cannot be formulated either for the quantifiable aspects (e.g. Category 1 twice in parallel still does not equate to Category 3, since it lacks fault detection) or with regard to the qualitative aspects (e.g. systematic failures, software, common cause failure). Usually, the only solution is therefore a re- evaluation of the entire system; in some cases it may be possible to exploit the intermediate results (e.g. the MTTFD or DC of blocks).

Since the various safety functions may make use of the same components, all safety functions must be considered during implementation. For example, for safeguarding on the operator side, the product standard governing paper-cutting guillotines, EN 1010-3, requires electro- sensitive protective equipment (ESPE, not shown here) for the safety function SF3, in addition to a two-hand control (THC). Safety function (SF2): • Controlled location of the operator's hands outside the danger zone during a hazardous movement 6.5.2 Implementation Where implementation takes the form of a two-hand control, this safety function can be described as fol - lows: when at least one of the two actuators S1 and S2 is released, the hazardous movement of the clamping bar and knife is interrupted, and both the clamping bar and the knife are returned to their initial positions by spring force. A restart is prevented until both actuators have been released and a new cycle initiated by the two-hand control. Controlled location of the operator's hands is achieved by means of two actuators that must be operated simultaneously for the machine to be star - ted (for details, e.g. concerning immunity to defeating, see EN 574). The timing and logic of the electrical signals must be interpreted; a programmable electronic control system is a suitable solution for this purpose, and will generally also control the movement of the clamping bar and knife.

Besides the majority of functional parts of the control system required for operation of the machine within the process, certain safety-related details such as protective circuits (fuses, EMC) and “peripherals” (power supply, clock signals etc. for the logic) have also been omitted from the diagram. Owing to the required single-fault tolerance and tolerance of an accumulation of undetected faults, decoupling ele - ments for example are also required in practice between the interconnected inputs of the two logic channels, in order for a defective input on one channel not to cause interference on the other channel.

The cyclical nature of the cut operation cau - ses all system states to be cycled through, and faults can thus be detected. 6.5.4 Safety-related block diagram The description of the circuit arrangement in conjunc - tion with the circuit diagram and where applicable other descriptive documents (comprehensive specification) enables a control Category to be determined and the actual circuit to be mapped to an abstracted safety- related block diagram (Figure 6.16, see Page 78). It quickly becomes clear from this example that the safety function is executed in two-channel mode. Category 3 or 4 may therefore be considered. The high-quality test measures, by which combinations of faults can also be controlled, suggest Category 4. This is demonstrated explicitly by the verification step in Chapter 7 , as is checking of the quan - titative requirements for the MTTFD, DCavg and CCF (see below). The explanations provided in subclauses 6.2.8 and 6.2.9 are helpful for implementation in the safety- related block diagram. A proven procedure is to track the signal path, beginning at the actuator end, by asking: “How is the hazardous movement driven/prevented?”, in order then to follow the logic through to the sensors. SISTEMA Cookbook 1 [34] describes this step “From the schematic circuit diagram to the Performance Level” in more detail.

Rather, the redundancy begins within each button with the use of electrical break con - tact/make contact combinations. Each control channel monitors both hands/actuators by interpreting at least one electrical switching contact in each actuator. The safety-related block diagram therefore contains a make contact, e.g. S1/13-14, and a break contact, e.g. S2/21-22, in each channel. The safety-related block diagram differs substantially in this respect from the functional circuit diagram. Under certain circumstances, the actual implementation of the safety function may result in restrictions or recom - mendations for the application. For example, the effec - tiveness of fault detection by way of the work process is by definition closely related to the application.

All quantitative requirements for determining the PL that have been described thus far can be handled easily with this software, and all calculations including mathematical determining of the PL are auto - mated. Use of the exact DCavg and MTTFD values for calcu - lation is possible as a special option. For DCavg, the exact (in this case poorer) value of 98.6% is employed for cal - culation rather than exploitation of the 5% tolerance for a DCavg of “high” and substitution of a rounded 99% (for the tolerances for DC and MTTFD, cf. Note 2 in Tables 4 and 5 of the standard). Dropping below the 99% mark for Category 4, still within the tolerance band, initiates a warning mes - sage by SISTEMA, however.

Should this be the case, the software architecture, speci - fically scheduling of the tasks and the assignment of func - tions to them, must be modified. This would not result in changes to the specification of the software safety requirements; the system and module design, however, would have to be adapted and subjected once again to review in order to assure compliance with the specifica - tion. This is one example of how technical changes which become necessary during development may result in the V model being repeated in order for the modifications to be implemented in accordance with the QA requirements. The code for such modifications would be written and both the module and integration tests would have to be repeated. For the event of the firmware having to be modified after the first production batch has already been shipped, suitable measures such as an impact analysis of the modifications and appropriate development activities in accordance with the V model should be defined within the organization of development itself. 6.5.10 SRP/CS in combination Since the entire SRP/CS are structured end-to-end in a single Category",

Validation refers to demonstration of whether suitability is assured with regard to the imposed requirements. In other words, examination is performed during or at the end of the development/design process of whether the specified functional and design requirements upon the safety-related part of the machine control have in general been attained, or in the context of EN ISO 13849, whether the SRP/CS satisfies the relevant requirements of this standard for each safety function.• Reference is made in subclause 7 .6 to the commissioning test. • The aspect of verification of the user interface is addressed by the new subclause 7 .7 , which follows the treatment of the subject in EN ISO 13849-2, 4.1. c). • The example of verification and validation of the paper- cutting guillotine in subclause 7 .8 has been updated.

The figure is taken from Part 2 of EN ISO 13849, but has been simpli - fied graphically in order to present the V&V activities more clearly. The most important aspects of the verification and valida - tion procedure are explained below. 7 .1.1 Principles for verification and validation Verification and validation are intended to assure con - formity of the design of the SRP/CS with the reference standards. Since EN ISO 13849-1 is harmonized under the Machinery Directive as a Type B standard for machine controls, the V&V activities must demonstrate that each safety-related part and each of the safety functions that it performs satisfies the requirements of EN ISO 13849-1. The focus lies here upon the specified properties of the safety functions and the requirements for the specified Performance Level (refer also to subclauses 7 .3 and 7 .4). EN ISO 13849-2 also specifies that ergonomic design of the user interface(s) shall be addressed by the V&V pro - cess. These activities should be begun as early as possible during development/design, in order to detect and elimi - nate faults and deviations to the specification in time. The personnel tasked with measures for verification and vali - dation should if possible not be involved in the process of designing the safety-related parts, i.e. they should be able to act independently of the design and development process. The parties concerned may be other persons, departments or bodies that are not subordinate to the design department within the organization's hierarchy. The level of independence should be commensurate with the risk, i.e. the required Performance Level (PLr). 877 Verification and validation Figure 7.2: Overview of the verification and validation procedure according to EN ISO 13849-2 Start Design considerations (Section6) Validation plan (Section 7 .1.2)",

The principles of fault analysis are stated in Annexes A to D of EN ISO 13849-2 as faults to be considered (modes of failure) and fault exclusions. Annex C of the present report describes the subjects of fault lists, assumed faults/modes of failure and fault exclusions in detail. These general fault lists are based upon past experience. A small number of further standards, such as IEC 61800-5-2 [20] governing the functional safety of electrical power drive systems and IEC 61784-3 [39] governing functionally safe transmission on field buses, contain specialist fault lists. Annex A.2, Table A.1 of IEC 61508-2 governing the functional safety of programmable electronic systems also contains certain precise details of faults in CPU, RAM, ROM and clock. The fault model for highly integrated microelectronic components (microprocessors, DSPs, ASICs, FPGAs, SoCs etc.) is however generally somewhat abstract in its characterization. It is highly advantageous for standard elements (in both software and hardware) to be used for fault diagnostic measures (self-tests, monitoring routines, monitoring components), both for implementation and for demonstration. Examples of such standard elements are the standard CPU self-tests stated in BGIA Report 7/2006, Self-tests for microprocessors incorporating safety func - tions [50]; RAM self-tests such as Galpat, March, Checker - board, and numerous others; and commercial watchdog/ monitoring modules for IEC 61508/ISO 26262 applica - tions.

Fault lists exist in standards neither for SRESW nor SRASW (see subclause 6.3).

The valves 2V1, 2V2, 1V3 and 1V4 are monitored cycli - cally indirectly by the pressure switches 2S1 and 1S3. Since the positions of the valves can be queried for their plausibility parallel to the machine cycle, a value of 99% for the DC is regarded as reasoned.",

Further measures are also effective in parts of the control system. 15 points are allowed for implementa - tion of the measure “physical separation between the signal paths”. Correct implementation of the measure shall be demonstrated by an analysis of development documentation such as circuit diagrams, and by tests on the hardware. The diversity employed for K1 and K2 makes a substantial contribution to the CCF: the diffe -rent technologies of K1 and K2 are the reasoning for the 20 points assigned for diversity. • Verification of the measures against systematic failures The observance of basic and well-tried safety principles is a highly effective measure against systematic fail- ures. The activities for verification of the Category also encompass checking of whether both types of safety principle have been observed. The results of the analy - ses and tests performed for that purpose can thus also be used for assessment in this phase. Besides the tests, an inspection is performed during development of the documentation describing the basic and well-tried safety principles applied and the measures for the control and avoidance of systematic failures according to subclause 6.1.2 of this report and Annex G of the standard. The purpose of this inspection is assessment of whether the principles and measures have been adequately considered during the develop - ment process. An example of the control of systematic system failures is that the safety-related software monitors execution of the program sequence for errors. The effectiveness of process monitoring is tested by injected faults. In order to demonstrate the capacity of the SRP/CS",

Subclauses 5.7 , 6.5 and 7 .6 then illustrated, with reference to the example of a paper- cutting guillotine, how the methods for the design of safe control systems can be implemented. The methods for determining the PL are described step by step here and in EN ISO 13849-1; some of these steps however, such as deriving the safety-related block diagram from the circuit diagram, require some practice. SISTEMA Cookbook 1 [33] provides guidance on deriving the safety-related block diagram and the SISTEMA file from the circuit diagram. However, owing to the variety of possible safety functions and their implementation, the individual steps do not lend themselves to generic description. For this reason, this chapter will now present the evaluation of numerous circuit examples that implement the safety functions in various Categories and Performance Levels and by means of different technologies. In the circuit examples, the concept of a control system generally covers only the safety-related parts of control systems. The examples are limited to essential aspects, and therefore serve primarily to illustrate the methodology. Importance was attached in their selection to a wide spectrum of technologies and possible applications. Readers familiar with the 1997 report [9] on the Categories for safety-related control sys - tems to EN 954-1 will recognize some of the examples, to which for example calculation of the probability of failure has been added. Compared to the BGIA Report 2/2008e [57], certain examples that are no longer up to date have been deleted; one new example has however also been added. The examples are an interpretation of the Catego - ries, and have been compiled by the authors based upon many years of experience",

The examples serve to provide desig - ners with effective guidance for their own developments. Since the examples were created by different authors, some variation inevitably exists, for example in their presentation of details or in the reasoning behind certain numerical data. All calculations for the circuit examples were performed with the aid of Version 2.0 of the SISTEMA software application (see Annex H), the version available at the time of production of this report. Further circuit examples, including SISTEMA files, are also described in IFA Report 4/2018e, “Safe drive controls with frequency inverters” [22].The description in each example is structured as follows: • Safety function • Functional description • Design features • Remarks • Calculation of the probability of failure • More detailed references Under “safety function”, the name of the safety function is stated together with the events that trigger it and the required safety responses. The “functional description” describes the essential safety-related functions, based upon a conceptual sche - matic diagram. The behaviour in the event of a fault is explained, and measures for fault detection are stated. The particular characteristics in the design of the example in question, such as the application of well-tried safety principles and the use of well-tried components, are listed under the “design features”. The circuit diagrams are conceptual schematic diagrams that are limited solely to presentation of the safety function(s) with the relevant components required for this particular purpose.

Circuit details that are not essential for determining the safety-related block diagram have thus been deliberately omitted.

The diagrams also omit decoupling diodes in circuits in which sensor signals, for example, are read in redundantly into multiple logic units. This arrangement is intended to prevent an input becoming an output on redundant systems in the event of a fault, and thus influencing the second channel. These components are all essential in order for a control system to be imple - mented in accordance with a Category and a Performance Level. In accordance with the fault lists in EN ISO 13849-2, issues such as the influence of conductor short circuits must of course also be considered in relation to the safety function concerned and the conditions of use.

The Category is determined from the functional description and the design features. The MTTFD values employed in the calculations are marked as manufacturer‘s values (“[M]” for manufacturer), typical values from databases (“[D]” for database), or values from EN ISO 13849-1 (“[S]” for standard).

For certain components, neither reliable manufactu - rers‘ data nor database values were available at the time of production of the report. In this case, use was made of the parts count method for estimation of typical example values (marked “[E]” for estimated). The MTTFD values in this chapter should therefore be regarded in some cases more as estimates. The presentation of the assumed measures for diag - nostics ( DC) and against common cause failure (CCF) is limited to general information. Specific values for these two criteria are dependent upon the implementation, the application and the manufacturer. It is therefore possible for different DC values to be assumed for similar compo - nents in different examples.

Conversely, some sub-steps, such as fault exclusion, basic and well-tried safety principles or meas ures against systematic faults (including software) are mentioned only briefly. During implementation, appro priate attention must be paid to this aspect, since mis judgements or inadequate implementation of these meas ures could lead to a deterioration in the fault tole - rance or probability of failure. As an aid to understanding of the circuit examples and for their practical implementa - tion, the reader‘s attention is therefore drawn to Chapter 7 and Annex C, in which, for example, the basic and well- tried safety principles are described in detail. Finally, reference is made to “more detailed references”, where available. For each form of technology, certain comments of a gene - ral nature are made in the following technology-specific subclauses in order to provide a better understanding of the examples and for implementation of the Categories. Some of the circuit examples represent “control systems involving multiple technologies”. These “mixed” circuit examples are based upon the concept, enshrined in the standard, that a safety function is always implemented by “reception”, “processing” and “switching”, irrespective of the technology employed. 8.1 General technology-related remarks on the example control systems 8.1.1 Electromechanical controls Electromechanical controls primarily employ electrome - chanical components in the form of control devices (e.g. position switches, selector switches, pushbuttons) and switchgear (contactor relays, relays, contactors). These devices have defined switching positions. They do not generally change their switching state unless actuated externally or electrically. When selected properly and used as intended, they are largely immune to disturbance, such as electrical or electromagnetic interference. In this respect they differ, in some cases considerably, from electronic equipment. Their durability and failure mode can be influenced by suitable selection, dimensioning",

For the reasons stated above, the electromechanical com - ponents generally satisfy the “basic safety principles”, and in many cases are also to be regarded as “well-tried components” for safety applications. This holds true, however, only when the requirements of IEC 60204-1 [25] for the electrical equipment of the machine/installation are observed. In some cases, fault exclusions are possi - ble, for example on a control contactor with regard to pick- up in the absence of a control voltage, or non-opening of a break contact with direct opening action on a switch to IEC 60947-5-1 [56], Annex K. 1018 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Detailed information on the modelling of electromechani - cal components can be found in Annex D. 8.1.2 Fluid power controls On fluid power installations, the area of valves, i.e. valves controlling hazardous movements or states, should in particular be considered a “safety-related part of the control system”. The fluid power circuits listed below constitute example arrangements only. As a rule, the required safety functions can also be implemented by means of alternative control logic employing appropriate valve types, or for that matter in some cases by additional mechanical solutions such as hold devices or brakes. On hydraulic systems (see Figure 8.1), measures for pres - sure limitation in the system (1V2) and for filtration of the hydraulic fluid (1Z2) must also be considered in this con - text. The components 1Z1, 1S1 and 1S2 shown in Figure 8.1 are present in the majority of hydraulic systems and are of great importance, particularly for the condition of the hydraulic fluid and consequently for the valve functions.

The temperature indicator 1S1 constitutes suitable measures for limitation of the opera -ting temperature range and thus the operating viscosity range of the hydraulic fluid. If necessary, heating and/or cooling equipment must be provided in conjunction with closed-loop temperature control (refer also to Annex C in this context). The drive elements and the components for energy con - versions and transmission in fluid power systems gene - rally lie outside the scope of the standard. On pneumatic systems (see Figure 8.2, Page 102), the components for the prevention of hazards associated with energy conversion and the maintenance unit for compressed air conditioning must be considered from a safety perspective in conjunction with the valve area. In order for the possible energy conversions to be controlled with consideration for safety aspects, an exhaust valve is frequently used in conjunction with a pressure switch. In the circuit examples in this chapter, these components are marked 0V1 (exhaust valve) and 0S1 (pressure switch). The maintenance unit 0Z (see Figure 8.2) generally con - sists of a manual shut-off valve 0V10, a filter with water separator 0Z10 with monitoring of the contamination of the filter, and a pressure control valve 0V11 (with ade- quately dimensioned secondary venting).

The re quirements that must be met by fluid power systems are described in full in [58; 59]. [60 to 63] are further relevant standards. The majority of control system examples are electrohy - draulic or electropneumatic controls. A range of safety requirements on these control systems are satisfied by the electrical part of the control system, for example the requirement for energy changes on electrohydraulic con - trol systems to be controlled. On the control examples described here, the required safety function is the stopping of a hazardous movement or the reversal of a direction of movement. Prevention of unexpected start-up is implicitly included. The required safety function may however also be a defined pressure level or a pressure release, for example. The structures of most fluid power control systems are engineered in Categories 1, 3 or 4. Since Category B already requires observance of the relevant standards and of the basic safety principles, Category B and 1 fluid power control systems do not differ essentially in their control structure, but only in the higher safety-related reliability of the relevant valves. For this reason, this report does not present any Category B fluid power control systems.

If no particular measures are taken, the use of electronic components at temperatures below 0°C is subject to substantially greater constraints compared to electromechanical components. In addition, environmen - tal influences exist that are virtually irrelevant to electro - mechanical circuit elements but that present crucial prob - lems for electronic systems, namely any electromagnetic disturbances that are coupled into electronic systems in the form of conducted disturbance or electromagnetic fields. In some cases, greater effort is required in order for adequate resistance to disturbance to be attained for industrial use. Fault exclusion is virtually impossible on electronic components. In consequence, safety cannot in principle be guaranteed by the design of a particular component, but only by certain circuit concepts and by the application of appropriate measures for the control of faults. According to the fault lists for electrical/electronic compo - nents to EN ISO 13849-2, the faults of short circuit, open circuit, change of a parameter or a value, and stuck-at faults are essentially assumed. These are without excep - tion fault effects that are assumed to be permanent. Tran - sient (sporadically occurring) faults such as soft errors caused by charge reversal of a capacitor in a chip owing to high-energy particles such as alpha particles can gene - rally be detected only with difficulty and controlled for the most part by structural measures. The failure mode of electronic components is frequently difficult to evaluate; generally, no predominant failure mode can be defined. This can be illustrated by an example: if a relay or contactor is not actuated electrically, i.e. current does not flow through its coil, there is no rea - son for the contacts to close when the",

The situation is different for the majority of electronic components, such as transistors. Even if a transistor is blocked, i.e. in the absence of a sufficiently high base current, the possi - bility still cannot be excluded of it suddenly becoming conductive without external influence as a result of an internal fault, and consequently under certain circumstan - ces initiating a hazardous movement. This drawback, from a safety perspective, of electronic components must also be controlled by a suitable circuit concept. Where highly integrated modules are used, in particular, it may not be possible to demonstrate that a device or item of equipment is completely free of faults even at the begin - ning of its mission time, i.e. at commissioning. Even at component level, manufacturers are no longer able to demonstrate freedom from faults with 100% test coverage for complex integrated circuits. A similar situation exists for the software of programmable electronics.In contrast to electromechanical circuits, purely electronic circuits often have the advantage that a change of state can be forced dynamically. This permits attainment of the required DC at appropriately short intervals and without alteration of the state of external signals (forced dyna - mics). Decoupling measures are required between different channels in order to prevent common cause failures. These measures generally consist of galvanically isolated contacts, resistor or diode networks, filter circuits, opto - couplers and transformers. Systematic failures may lead to simultaneous failure of redundant processing channels if this is not prevented by timely consideration, in particular during the design and integration phase.

Measures that render the processing channels insensitive to the physical influences encountered for example in an indus - trial environment should not be ignored. Such influences include temperature, moisture, dust, vibration, shock, corrosive atmospheres, electromagnetic influences, vol - tage breakdown, overvoltage and undervoltage. A Category 1 SRP/CS must be designed and manufac - tured with the use of well-tried components and well-tried safety principles. Since complex electronic components such as PLCs, microprocessors or ASICS are not deemed well-tried in the sense of the standard, this report con - tains no corresponding examples of Category 1 electro - nics. The circuit examples include a statement of the effec - tiveness, i.e. the associated Performance Level, of the required measures for fault avoidance/fault control for the programmable electronics. Further details can be found in subclause 6.3. Should ASICs be employed in a development, measures for fault avoidance are required in the development process. Such measures can be found for example in IEC 61508-2 [48], which specifies a V model for the development of an ASIC, based upon the V model familiar from software development. The following points are worthy of mention, since such issues arise in practice: • Generally, two channels of an SRP/CS must not be rou - ted through the same integrated circuit. For optocoup - lers, this requirement means for example that they must be housed in separate enclosures when they are used to process signals from different channels. • The influence of operating systems etc. must also be considered where programmable electronics are employed.

For T1, the DC is 60%, likewise as a result of fault detection by the process. K1 and K2 exhibit a DC of 99% owing to the integral fault detection in K4. For K3, the DC is 99% owing to fault detection by K5. For C1, the DC is 60% owing to testing in the PLC of the timing element with the FI shut-off by way of the drop-out time of the contactor relay K3. For Q1, the DC is then 99% owing to direct monitoring in K5. The averaging formula for the DCavg yields a result of 64% (“low”). • Adequate measures against common cause failure (75 points): separation (15), diversity (20), FMEA (5) and envi -",

Functional description • The multi-purpose control (MPC) S1 converts the operator‘s manual movement of it into electronic messages. It sends these messages cyclically over a serial data communications line (bus system) to the logic control. This generates control signals for the hydraulics, which in turn executes the working movements of the earth-moving machine desired by the operator. • The message 1 sent by the MPC S1 reaches the microcontroller K3 via the bus transceiver K1. From message 1 and in accordance with the algorithms stored in the software, K3 generates the analog signals required for actuation of the proportional valve 1V4. The resistances R1/R2 and the measuring amplifiers K6/K8 have the function of cont - rolling the output currents for the proportional valve. The microcontroller K4 receives a redundant message 2 from S1 via the bus transceiver K2. Within the response time/process safety time, K4 checks the correct displacement of the proportional valve 1V4, as signalled by the position measuring system 1S4 integrated into 1V4, for plausibility against the desired position determined from message 2. Should faults be detected, K4 switches off the hydraulic pressure at a higher level by means of the directional control valve 1V3, and places the system in the safe state.

For the remaining part of the control system, the probabi - lity of failure is calculated below. • MTTFD of data communication: an MTTFD of 11,416 years [D] is assumed for the bus transceivers K1 and K2. This is capped in Category 4 to the maximum value of 2,500 years. • DCavg of data communication: DC = 99% for K1 and K2 by cross monitoring of the messages in the microcontrollers K3 and K4. • The calculated probability of failure of data communication is a PFHD of 9.1 · 10-10 per hour. • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10).

Remarks • The emergency stop function is a complementary protective measure to EN ISO 12100 [3]. Calculation of the probability of failure • Each of the three safety functions can be presented in three subsystems. The safety-related block diagram shows the safety-related stop function by way of example for one of the safeguards, since only one guard is opened at any given time. A comparable safety function with a virtually identical calculation of the probability of failure applies to the second guard. Reasoning must be provided for fault exclusion for breakage of the actuator of the position switch B3. The probability of failure of the subsystems is calculated as follows. • S1 is a standard emergency stop device to EN ISO 13850. A B10D value of 100,000 switching cycles for each contact can be substituted for emergency stop devices, irrespective of the load [S]. Three actuations per year is assumed for nop. In consideration of the total switching operations of Q1 caused by actuation of the safeguards, this value is not applied during further analysis of the two safety functions. • MTTFD (guard 1, loading): switch B1 is a position switch with make contact. The B10D is 1 · 105 switching cycles [M]. For the position switch B2 with direct opening action and roller actuation, the B10D is 20 · 106 switching cycles [M].",

Functional description • The hazardous movement is interrupted redundantly if either the stop button S1 or the protective device K3 – shown in the circuit diagram as electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) – is activated. The drive is halted in an emergency following actuation of the emergency stop device S4. In all three cases, stopping is initiated via the output O3 of the PLC K4 by deactivation of the “Start/Stop” input on the frequency inverter (FI) T1. Redundantly to this process, the input “STO2” on T1 is deactivated by de-energization of the contactor relay K1 (with the use of the capacitor C1 for drop-out delay). A further shut-off path exists on the “STO1” input on T1 via the output O2 of the PLC K4: this also causes the brake Q2 to be applied. The first shut-off path is thus implemented directly by the PLC K4; conversely, the second shut-off path employs relay technology and delayed drop-out.

Calculation of the probability of failure • The probability of failure PFHD of safe stopping initiated by the emergency stop device S4 or by the ESPE is calcu- lated. The “fast stop” function of the FI and the facility for de-energization of the power supply to the FI via Q1 are not considered in the calculation of the probability of failure of the safety function. • The FI T1 with STO is available for purchase as a safety component; its probability of failure is added at the end of the calculation (1.5 · 10-8 per hour [M]). The stop function of the FI is modelled in the first channel of the block diagram (T1stop). The FI with STO would in fact be modelled in the second channel of the block diagram; a model with a turnkey safety component including PFHD in a single channel is however not covered by the standard. The FI T1 and its STO function are therefore considered as a single subsystem. This estimation therefore errs on the safe side. 1708 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Safe stop initiated by the emergency stop device S4: • MTTFD: the following MTTFD values are estimated: 50 years for K4 and 100 years for the stop function T1stop of the FI [E].

Functional description • This example shows implementation of the SLS safety function with a frequency inverter without integrated safety function. The SLS safety function is used for example for inching mode during servicing tasks. • A hazardous movement is safely prevented or interrupted when the safety guard is open. Opening of the safety guard is detected by two position switches B1 and B2 employing a break-contact/make-contact element combi- nation. When the pushbutton S1 is actuated, a movement at a safely limited speed (inching mode) is initiated by means of the safety PLC K1. The two processing channels within the PLC each process a set limit value. The actual value of the limited speed on the inputs I3.0 and I3.1 of K1 is monitored by two separate rotary encoders G1 and G2. Each channel of the PLC performs the desired/actual speed comparison independently. Should the speed not be reduced successfully to the limited value by means of T1, K1 can initiate a halt by blocking the start/stop signal and servo enable on the frequency inverter. The power supply to T1 is also interrupted by the mains contactor relay Q1 after a programmed timeout. • The two-channel safety PLC K1 performs internal fault detection.

This PLC‘s probability of failure of 1.5 · 10-7 per hour [E] is added at the end of the calculation for the sensor/actuator subsystem. For the composition of the block diagram, refer also to Figure 6.14 and the relevant information in the associated text. The probability of failure for the sensor/actuator subsystem is calculated below. • MTTFD: at 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of one hour, nop is 1,920 cycles per year. A B10D value of 20,000,000 cycles [S] is assumed for the position switch B1 owing to its direct opening action; the associated MTTFD value is 104,166.7 years. Owing to the defined control current (low load; the mechanical durability of the con- tacts is the determining factor), a B10D value of 100,000 cycles [E] is assumed for the make-contact element, which is opened by spring force (see also Table D.2), and therefore an MTTFD of 520 years.

Functional description • A hazard zone is safeguarded by means of a guard, opening of which is detected by a safety module K1. The safety module actuates a contactor Q2 and a combination comprising a contactor monitoring module F1 and an undervol - tage release Q1. The dropping-out of Q2 interrupts hazardous movements and prevents hazardous states from ari- sing. The contactor monitoring module F1 has the function of monitoring the main contacts of the contactor Q2 for contact welding. Should Q2 fail to drop out, F1 trips the upstream circuit-breaker or motor starter Q1 via the latter‘s undervoltage release. The circuit-breaker or motor starter then switches off the motor. • The safety function is preserved in the event of a component failure. • An accumulation of faults between two successive actuations can lead to loss of the safety function. 2118 Circuit examples for SRP/CS F1 Q1 Q2 K1 Design features • The circuit-breaker Q1 is checked regularly by means of a test function that is to be implemented manually. The interval between the tests should not exceed one-hundredth of the MTTFD of Q1; the test could be performed for example during maintenance of the machine. The contactor Q2 is tested continually by the contactor monitoring module. Loss of the safety function between the tests, as is possible with Category 2, cannot occur. The single-fault safety is thus assured and the requirements of Category 3 are met. • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • For reasons of simplification, details of the safeguard have been omitted",

Only when both pushbuttons are operated synchronously (i.e. within a maximum time of 500 ms as specified in EN 574) from within the released state do the contactor relays K2 and K3 pick up, resulting in enabling. When at least one of the pushbuttons S1/S2 is released, K2/K3 cancel enabling. • K2 and K3 have the function of contact multiplication/load adaptation. The actual prevention of the hazardous movement, for example by separation of the electrical or hydraulic energy, is dependent upon the application and is not shown here. • Faults in the actuating mechanism are detected in S1/S2 to the greatest extent possible by the use of two con- tacts employing different principles (break and make contact combination).

Functional description • Actuation of the two-hand control (THC) S1 and S2 initiates the hazardous movements (processing cycle) of the clamping bar (hydraulic) 1A and of the knife (electromechanical). If, during this cycle, either of the pushbuttons S1 or S2 is released or a signal change occurs in the peripheral system of the machine (e.g. light curtain, not shown on the diagram) that is not expected by the control system, the cycle is stopped and the machine remains in this safe state. Owing to their immediate physical proximity to each other, the knife and the clamping bar constitute a common hazard zone. The hazard occurs cyclically. The knife is driven by an eccentric drive that draws its energy from a flywheel mass in constant motion. The drive is not shown explicitly. The clamping bar is driven linearly by a hydraulic arrangement employing a pump connected to the drive of the flywheel mass. • When pushbuttons S1/S2 (THC) are pushed, the signal change is communicated to the two microcontrollers K1 and K2. Provided these signals satisfy the requirements for simultaneity in accordance with the standard (EN 574, Type III C) and all peripheral signals satisfy the condition for a start, K1 and K2 set the outputs for a valid cut",

Injury to persons in such hazard zones can be avoided, for example by the use of closing edge protection devices. Closing edge protection devices, such as pressure-sensi-tive edges, are fitted to the closing edges of the moving wings. When an obstacle is detected, the closing move-ment is interrupted and a reverse movement is initiated. Crush and shear points on powered windows, doors and gates may cause severe and, under some circumstances, fatal injury. A severity of injury of S2 must therefore be assumed. Persons are infrequently (frequency lower than once every fifteen minutes) and only briefly (total duration of exposure less than 1/20 of the entire operation time) present in the area of the crushing and shearing points (F1). Under normal circumstances, persons at risk are able to move out of the hazard zone formed by the moving wing (P1). This yields a required Pe Level PL r of c. This result is confirmed by the EN 12453 product standard. The standards committee evidently saw no reason to deviate from this owing to the incidence and severity of accidents. Example 13 in [1] shows how this safety function can be achieved. 1 In the past, closing edge protection devices were governed by the Construction Products Directive. Since the pressure-sensitive edges use constitute safety components under the Machinery Directive, however, closing edge protection devices are also evaluated in accordance with this directive.On fast-moving gates it is virtually impossible for persons to move out of the danger zone in time. The assessment of P2 instead of P1 thus yields a required Performance Level PL r of d for these products.

This example considers the hazard zone on a printing press on which maintenance work requires manual inter - vention at reduced machine speeds. The access to the entrapment point is protected by a guard door (safeguar - ding). The following safety functions are implemented: • SF1 – Opening of the guard door during operation causes the cylinders to be braked to a halt. • SF2 – When the guard door is open, any machine move - ments must be performed at limited speed. • SF3 – When the guard door is open, movements are possible only whilst an inching button is pressed. Entrapment between the cylinders causes severe injuries (S2). Since tasks are performed in the hazard zone only during maintenance work, the frequency of exposure to the hazard can be described as low (less frequently than once every 15 minutes); the entire exposure duration is lower than 1/20 of the entire operation time (F1). At production speeds, no possibility exists of avoiding the hazard (P2). This therefore results in a required Perfor - mance Level PLr of d for the safety functions SF1 and SF2 (see Figure A.4). The safety function SF3 can however be used only if the printing press has first been halted (SF1) and the permissible rotational speed of the cylinders limited (SF2). This results in the possible machine move - ments being predictable for the operator, who is thus able to evade hazardous movements (P1). A required Perfor - mance Level PLr of c is therefore adequate for SF3 (see Figure A.4).

B.1 Purpose and generation of a safety-related block diagram The result of the safety-oriented analysis of the system structure is presented conveniently in the form of a block diagram, which can be described as a “safety-related block diagram”. The diagram is intended to show whether the safety function is executed in whole or part by a sin - gle-channel or multi-channel solution, and the available diagnostics by which internal component failures can be detected. Since – with regard to the aspect of relevance here, i.e. quantification of the probabilities of failure – diagnostics represents a means of compensating for com - ponent failures, the term “failure detection” will be used in this Annex in place of the usual term “fault detection”. In the field of machine safety, it is generally accepted that in the event of a control-system failure, a substitute response should occur in place of the safety function originally implemented, and that the substitute reaction 2 The FMEA described here also considers the detection of fai - lures (diagnostics), and can therefore also be termed FMEDA (failure mode, effects and diagnostic analysis).should initiate a safe state, such as operating inhibi - tion with de-energized outputs (shut-down system). In accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, the Category and PL are intended to indicate only the safety quality, and not the probability of fault-free operation, i.e. the “availability”. For this reason, signal paths that initiate a safe state in the event of a fault are regarded as being fully equiva - lent to functional units that may perform complex safety functions.

If the safety path cannot become active until a failure in the main function path proper has been detected, its safety benefit is dependent upon the quality of the failure detection mechanism.

Architectural features of this kind must be expressed correctly on the safety-related block diagram. The differentiated presenta - tion of a true two-channel arrangement and a monitored single channel can be seen clearly from a comparison of Figures 10 and 11 in the standard. Consideration must also be given to whether components or circuit elements are present which, although they do not execute the safety function or the safety-related sub - stitute function in the event of a fault, may be able to pre - vent other components from properly executing the safety or substitute function should certain component failures occur. Such circuit components include those providing necessary auxiliary functions such as the power supply or control functions that are not (intentionally) relevant to safety but that may have an impact upon safety-related parts. Where components and parts of circuits may impact negatively upon the safety function, its substitute function, or diagnostics functions in the event of failures, they must always be considered in a function block. For example, components for assurance of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) must be examined with regard to whether their failure, for example short-circuiting of a capacitor, has negative effects upon safety-related cir - cuits. Parts of circuits with defined inputs and outputs may be regarded as a function block. In order to keep the number of required function blocks as low as possible, parts of circuits that are arranged functionally",

Blocks differing from this arrangement should logically be grouped only to the extent that redundancies such as separate shut-off paths and the mutual diagnostics of 252 252Annex B function blocks are still expressed. The circuit analysis must ultimately produce a block diagram in which all the structures that are of relevance to safety are reflected: • Single or parallel signal paths (“channels”) that are used to execute the safety function • Signal paths that execute a safety-related substitute function in the event of a fault • Circuits for the detection of failures (diagnostics) Where auxiliary circuits that are required for performance of the safety function or for some other safety-related action (e.g. power supplies, oscillators) are able to influ - ence one channel only, they should be grouped with the function block(s) of the channel concerned. Should these auxiliary circuits act upon several channels, they form a separate single-channel part (function block) on the safety-related block diagram. The same principle applies to circuits that are able to prevent performance of the safety function, another safety-related action or diagnostics owing to a particular manner of their failure. Examples include circuits for selection of a safe operating mode, or certain components for the assurance of EMC. The content of each function block must be determined unambiguously by circuit diagrams and parts lists.

In both cases, the dangerous (i.e. unfavourable from a safety perspective) failure rate, specifically its reciprocal, the MTTFD (mean time to dangerous failure), and the DC (diagnostic coverage) of the function blocks in the safety- related block diagram must be known. For calculation of these values, a special variation of the FMEA is used that employs the component failure rates in the form of quantitative values.

The signal-pro - cessing elements of the “light barrier” function block (K1 to K3, R2 to R9, C1) are required to behave in the same way as in response to a “real” demand of the safety func - tion caused by interruption of the light beam. This test is described below as “Test 1”. B.2.2 Dangerous failure mode of a function block The first step entails identification of the dangerous fail- ure mode of the function block. Generally, not only may individual elements fail, but an entire function block may also fail in various ways as a result. The modes of failure that are unfavourable from a safety perspective are regarded as the “dangerous” failure mode of a function block. Some failures cause immediate, dangerous fail- ure of the entire system, with the result that neither the original safety function, nor a safety-oriented substitute function can be performed. Other failures increase the probability of this happening in that a smaller number of further failures is now sufficient to cause the system to fail dangerously. Should no redundancy exist for the function block suffering failure, i.e. no second channel capable of assuming its function, and should diagnostics fail to per - form sufficiently rapidly an action producing a safe state, the dangerous failure of the function block leads to dan - gerous failure of the system.

The dangerous failure mode is that leading to the function block no longer making its intended contribution to safe behaviour of the system. On occasions it may be necessary for several failure modes that are characterized by different but equally harmful block behaviour to be considered (e.g. continuous ener - gization and oscillation on the output). The simplest solu - tion is therefore to describe the dangerous failure mode in terms of the loss of the function block‘s safety-related functionality. Diagnostics features are considered later and will be ignored at this stage. In the example under consideration here (light barrier, Figure B.2), the output voltage of the function block is to drop to zero for as long as the phototransistor K1 fails to receive light from the LED P1, since this constitutes the contribution of this function block to performance of the safety function: “safe torque off when the light beam is interrupted”. The dangerous failure mode of the function block can thus be described as “presence of an output voltage greater than zero during non-illumination of the phototransistor K1”. B.2.3 Component failure rates Component failure rates may be obtained from a num - ber of sources. Examples for electronic components are listed in [3 to 6]. These sources all contain generic data relevant to multiple manufacturers. Collections of failure rates also exist for mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic components.

In particular, a method is shown here by which failure rates for discrete, cyclically operating elec - tromechanical, fluid power and mechanical components can be derived from the “B10D” values (see Table D.2 of this report). Should a conservative estimate of the failure rate not be chosen, it must be ensured for each component that the value employed is valid under the conditions of use (tem - perature, current, voltage, power dissipation, etc.) in the application in question. The inherent heating effect must also be taken into account.

In the next step, the total failure rate λ of each component is divided into the proportions λS (“safe” mode, i.e. safe failure) and λD (“dangerous” mode, i.e. dangerous failure). For this purpose, information such as the “dangerous failure mode” of the function block must be known (see above). A “puristic” approach requires this to be perfor - med in two steps. Firstly, the total failure rate is distributed between the various failure types (e.g. open circuit, short circuit, drift, change in function). Information on the failure type distribution of a range of components can be found for example in IEC 61709 [7] and IEC/TR 62380 [4]. Typical failure type distributions can also be found in commercial FMEDA software. The data in the various sources are not consistent. Unnecessary selection of a different source for the failure type distribution from component to compo - nent is not acceptable. In the second step, the proportions accounted for by each failure type are assigned to λS or λD, according to whether the failure type concerned causes the function block to fail in its safe or unsafe mode.

For components intended to enhance the circuit‘s resis - tance to disturbance phenomena, such as electromag - netic interference or excessive ambient temperature, it is advantageous to distinguish between two possible cases for assessment of the function block‘s behaviour. If the incidence of disturbance phenomena is merely “possible” and the function of the circuit measure is essentially to increase the availability of the device under (infrequent) unfavourable conditions, simultaneous presence of the “disturbance phenomenon” in the event of component failure need not be assumed during assessment of the function-block behaviour. Conversely, should the device‘s intended form of operation be associated with occasional to continuous presence of the disturbance or should this be anticipated in view of the typical operating conditions (e.g. installation within the range of known sources of electromagnetic interference or at a hot site), assessment of the component failure must take account of the dis - turbance.

RDF (ratio of dangerous failure) represents the fraction of the overall failure rate of an element that can result in a dangerous failure. EN ISO 13849-1, Annex C.4.2, Foot - note 2 also follows this approach with RDF = 0.5. This method of calculation is however based upon simplified assumptions that may differ considerably from the actual conditions for the wearing parts under analysis here. For this reason, B10D should be limited to twice the value of B10 when B10D is determined by means of the quotient B10/RDF. Owing to the relationship in formula C.3 in EN ISO 13849- 1, Annex C.4.2, the method for determining the B10D also has an impact upon the permissible component operation time T10D and thus possibly also upon replacement inter - vals to be specified for the component. The next step in the method entails consideration for diagnostics. Only diagnostics relating to dangerous-mode failures (of the function block) are considered. Conside - ration for whether a test or where applicable several tests are capable of detecting some or all of these failures need therefore be given only for components that exhibit a portion of dangerous-mode failures. The relevant effective test, and the diagnostic coverage DC for the components indicating the detectable portion of dangerous-mode failures, are entered in appropriate columns. Where the components concerned are discrete components as in the example shown in Figure B.2, one of the two DC values “0” for “undetectable” or “1” for “detectable” can often be assigned to the dangerous failure of a single compo - nent.

Support in this assessment is provided by Table E.2, in which DC values of 0% (“none”), 60% (“low”), 90% (“medium”) and 99% (“high”) are assigned for standard test methods. During assignment of a DC to a component, it must also be considered that an evaluation result of “detectable” is permissible only if the system is actually capable of performing the intended safety-orien - ted operation. Detection of a failure within a circuit, for example, is useless if it is rendered ineffective owing to a shut-off path that has already failed. In the example shown, the components R1, R6 to R9 and P1 do not need to be considered with regard to the aspect of diagnostics, since they are not capable of causing dan - gerous-mode failure of the “light barrier” function block. The dangerous-mode failure portion of each of these components is 0. Dangerous-mode failure of elements R2 to R5, K1 to K3 and X1 is detected fully by “Test 1” (the only test in this example), i.e. when LED P1 is switched off for test purposes, the test detects an output voltage of > 0. The component-related DC value of “1” is therefore assigned to these elements. The situation is different for the capacitor C1, which has the function of suppressing frequent but not continuous electromagnetic interference (note: this is assumed for the purpose of this example). Drift failures (limited changes in capacitance) are not critical; a short-circuit, however, results in the output (ter - minal X1.2) being incapable of being de-energized (dan - gerous failure mode of the function block).

It is un clear how the downstream circuit will interpret this high-fre- quen cy alternating signal, and also whether the distur - bance phenomenon is present during the test. In the worst case, the non-suppressed interference results in the output signal with superimposed disturbance not being interpreted by the downstream circuit as a demand of the safety function, despite phototransistor K1 not being illu - minated (= dangerous failure of the “light barrier” func - tion block). Should the fault not be present at the time of the test, Test 1 is not able to detect the capacitor open circuit. Since no reliable information on the failure-type distribution is available for the capacitor, it is assumed that – when the non-critical drift failures are disregarded – short circuits and open circuits each account for 50% of the failures. Both failure types lead to a dangerous failure of the function block; only short-circuiting of the capa - citor, i.e. (an estimated) half of all dangerous capacitor failures, are however reliably detectable. The component- related diagnostic coverage is thus estimated at 50% or 0.5. The printed circuit board and its solder joints can introduce short circuits and open circuits into the circuit at various points. The pragmatic approach, implemented in Figure B.3, for estimation of the DC value for the sol - der joints and printed circuit board consists in assigning the average DC value to them that is produced for all other components of the function block from the formula DC = Σ λDD/Σ λD. The inclusion of the printed circuit board and solder joints thus has no influence upon the DC value calculated for",

The example shown yields an MTTFD value of 9,905.9 years and a DC of 91.72%. If a different quantification method is employed, values from the FMEA table such as λDD and λDU may also be used. B.3 Parts count method Time and effort can be saved by use of a simpler method instead of an FMEA. If a detailed analysis of the circuit behaviour is not performed for the various failure types of the individual elements, the parts count method is an alternative (cf. Annex D of this report). This method was originally found in the MIL Handbook 217F (superseded by [6]), and a variant of it is described in EN ISO 13849, Part 1, Annex D.1.

The parts count method normally delivers poorer (lower) MTTFD values than the FMEA results, since higher failure rates are generally input, and components are also considered that are capable of causing only safe-mode function-block failures. If the parts count principle is applied to the example described above (light barrier), with assumption of the failure rates adjusted for temperature in Figure B.3 and a blanket proportion of dangerous failures for all compo - nents of 50%, the resulting MTTFD value is 7 ,310.8 years. This value is approximately 26% poorer than the FMEA result. The inferior value is due in this example solely to the omission of a circuit analysis. If a DC value is required for the function block, the component-related DC for each component must estimated as with the FMEA method or, for example with reference to Annex E, the DC of the entire function block. The FMEA method for quantification purposes presented in this annex of the report with reference to an electronic circuit can be transferred to other technologies.

Individual product standards such as IEC 61800-5-2 [2] and IEC 61496-1 [3] also contain fault lists or supple - ments to the fault lists stated. Document 340 220 in the IFA Manual [4] explains the background and origins of the fault lists. C.2 Fault exclusions Without the assumption of fault exclusions, some safe control systems would not be achievable at reasonable expense. Reasons for fault exclusion include, in particu - lar, the physical impossibility of a certain type of fault or the technical improbability of a fault occurring, and also generally accepted technical experience (see also sub - clause 7 .3 of EN ISO 13849-1).

EN ISO 13849-2 describes pos - sible fault exclusions for certain discrete components, where considered permissible. The information in the following examples has been updated where required to bring it into line with standard practice. C.2.1 Examples of fault exclusions on components C.2.1.1 Fluid power components The fault exclusions formulated for pneumatic and hy draulic components are frequently similar. Fault exclu - sions specific to one of the forms of fluid power also exist, however. Example of fault exclusions common to fluid power components of both types: • Directional control valves The fault assumption: “failure to switch or failure to switch completely” can be excluded under the fol - lowing conditions: positive mechanical operation of the moving parts, provided the actuating force is suf - ficiently high. On hydraulic directional control valves, a fault exclusion can be formulated for the failure of a special type of seat and cartridge valve (refer to the remarks in EN ISO 13849-2, Table C.3) to open when it controls the main volumetric flow of the pressure medium in conjunction with at least one further valve. C.2.1.2 Electrical components • Optocouplers The fault assumption of a “short-circuit between any two input and output connections” can be excluded under the following conditions: the optocoupler is con - structed in accordance with overvoltage Category III to IEC 60664-1. If an SELV/PELV power supply is employed, pollution degree 2/overvoltage Category II is sufficient. Measures are taken to ensure that an internal fault in the optocoupler cannot lead to an excessive rise in the temperature of its insulating materials. • Printed circuit board/populated printed circuit board In accordance with the standard, the fault assumption of a “short-circuit between adjacent tracks/pads” can",

C.5 Well-tried components Well-tried components for mechanical and electrical systems are dealt with by Tables A.3 and D.3 of the infor - mative annexes of EN ISO 13849-2. Well-tried components are used in order to minimize or exclude critical faults or failures and thus to reduce the probability of faults or fail- ures that impact upon the safety function. In accordance with the provisions for Category 1, general criteria for a well-tried component are that it: a) has been widely used in the past with successful results in similar applications; or b) has been made and verified using principles which demonstrate its suitability and reliability for safety- related applications. Complex electronic components (such as PLCs, micropro - cessors, ASICs) cannot be regarded as well-tried in the sense of the standard. Classification as a well-tried com - ponent is also dependent upon the application: a compo - nent may be considered well-tried in certain applications, whereas in other applications this must be excluded, for example owing to the environmental influences.C.5.1 Example of a well-tried component in mechanical technology • Spring A spring is deemed to be a well-tried component when the provisions in EN ISO 13849-2, Table A.2 concerning well-tried safety principles for the application of well- tried springs and the technical provisions for spring steels to ISO 4960 [8] are observed.

This emphasizes several aspects: • The MTTFD is a statistical value, i.e. a value of empirical origin; in no way does it refer to a “guaranteed lifetime”, “failure-free time”, or the like. • The MTTFD has the physical dimension of a period of time, and is generally stated in years. • Only dangerous-mode failures are relevant, i.e. failures that impair performance of the safety function. Should the safety function be executed by several channels (redundancy), the term “dangerous failure” is used even if only one channel is affected.D.1.1 Bath-tub life curve and constant failure rate Component reliability is commonly described in terms of failure rates, abbreviated λ (and accordingly λD for dan - gerous failures only), the usual unit being FIT (failures in time, i.e. number of failures in 109 component hours, 1 FIT = 10-9 per hour). This failure rate describes the rate, at a particular point in time, at which functional components fail. In other words, the number of failures per unit time is divided by the number of components which at the point in time concerned have not yet suffered failure. The failure mode of many types of components (particularly electro - nic components) as a function of time takes the form, to a greater or lesser degree, of a “bath-tub life curve” [1] (see Figure D.1).

Random failures are typi - cal for this phase. Even components which are affected more strongly by wear than by random failures, such as electromechanical or pneumatic components, can often be described over their mission time by the assumption of a constant failure rate estimated erring on the safe side. Early failures are generally disregarded, since com - 266Annex D ponents exhibiting pronounced early failure patterns do not satisfy the availability requirements for a machine control system and are therefore not generally signifi - cant on the market. Suitable measures for the reduction of early failures are premature ageing (burn-in), selec - tion, and optimization of the manufacturing process. In the interests of simplicity, constant failure rates within the mission time are therefore generally assumed in EN ISO 13849-1. The advantage of this assumption is that subsequent mathematical analysis is considerably simplified as a result, and forms the basis for the Markov modelling of the designated architectures upon which the bar chart/the simplified method of EN ISO 13849-1 are based. A constant failure rate results mathematically in a reliability curve which falls exponentially over the mission time, and in an anticipated value for the time to failure (MTTFD) which corresponds to the reciprocal of the failure rate, i.e.: MTTFDλD1= (D.1) At a constant failure rate, the MTTFD is therefore equiva - lent to statement of a failure rate, whilst being much more illustrative. Whereas the practical significance of an FIT value is not very illustrative, statement of an anticipated time in years conveys the quality of components more graphically.

A further mathematical relationship can be observed here: at attainment of the MTTFD mark on the time axis, a stati -stical average of approximately 63% of all initially intact components have failed dangerously (not 50%, since although more components fail prior to attainment of the MTTFD, the remaining, intact components with residual operation times in some cases of several times the MTTFD are of greater statistical influence). D.1.2 Division into classes and capping The assumption of an MTTFD for each component of rele - vance to safety (where reasons are not given for a fault exclusion) is a condition for the following steps, by which the MTTFD of each channel is produced, first at block and then at channel level. At channel level, EN ISO 13849-1 proposes division into three typical MTTFD classes (see Table D.1). These classes are intended to cancel out minor differences between the calculated MTTFD values, which in any case become irrelevant within the statistical uncer - tainty. They also serve to retain the equivalence to the other parameters (five Categories, four DC levels), and to provide the necessary simplification for presentation in the bar chart.

Consequently, and with knowledge of the characteristic of the failure rate over time (Figure D.1), it becomes clear that a declared MTTFD value should be understood only as an illustrative indicator of the level of reliability within the mission time, and that it serves neither as a guarantee of a failure-free period before the MTTFD is reached, nor as a precise prediction of the point in time at which an individual component will fail. Once the wear phase is reached, the failure behaviour changes 267Annex D fundamentally and can no longer be described realisti - cally by a constant failure rate. Desired side-effects of this classification are the rejec - tion of MTTFD values of < 3 years from each channel, and the capping of higher MTTFD values for each channel to a maximum of 100 years (this capping is raised to 2,500 years for Category 4; these values are also to be assigned to the “high” class). Figure D.2 shows that with an MTTFD of three years, almost 30% dangerous failures can be expected after just one year, which would appear to be unacceptable for a safety-related control system. At the other end of the scale, statistical validation of relia - bilities of > 100 years MTTFD appears highly questionable (this is acceptable in Category 4, since the other parame - ters determining the reliability, such as redundancy and fault detection, already have a high level). Furthermore, a residual probability of a dangerous failure within the mis - sion time remains at MTTFD values of any magnitude, and may occur for other reasons (e.g. maloperation).

In the bar chart to EN ISO 13849-1, this conclusion is expressed by the fact that no further MTTFD range is shown above the “high” MTTFD class, even though this would be possible according to the calculated probability. Higher MTTFD values are not capped to the maximum value of 100/2,500 years until the channel level, i.e. substantially higher MTTFD values may be substituted in the calculation for individual components. D.1.3 What is the origin of the data? A possible problem for users of the standard, particularly at the point at which the revised EN ISO 13849-1 was first published, was the lack of MTTFD data for components used in the SRP/CS [2]. In subclause 4.5.2, the standard proposes a hierarchy of data sources. The first of these are manufacturer's data [M], followed by typical values listed in the standard itself [S], and finally a very con - servatively estimated substitutional value of ten years. Since this substitutional value relates to a component, and the lower limit of three years for the MTTFD value is soon reached where several components are employed in a channel, the MTTFD values listed in the standard itself were and are of particular importance. This will continue to be the case, at least until statement by the manufac - turers of MTTFD values becomes the norm – including for components that were not developed from the outset for use in SRP/CS. D.2 Differences between technologies By its nature, the failure mode of components varies strongly according to the technology employed, since the “bath-tub characteristic” and the relevance of wear factors may differ. A very high MTTFD may be assumed for mechanical and hydraulic components, which are opti - mized in their design and use for high reliability and low wear. Random",

Conversely, for the majority of electronic compo - nents, the failure behaviour over the typical mission time of comparatively “cheap” industrial components is gene - rally well described by a constant failure rate, since the wear phase is reached only under exacerbated operating conditions. The failure behaviour of electromechanical or pneumatic components is very different again in its nature. The wear phase of these components can easily be reached within the usual mission time. For this reason, the attainable number of successful operation cycles is generally stated as the parameter, rather than a lifetime in terms of a time or failure rate per unit time. Consideration must be given to all these technology-specific aspects during calculation of the MTTFD value. For this reason, the standard proposes differentiated procedures. D.2.1 MTTFD of mechanical control components The approach employing constant failure rates is, unfor - tunately, not well suited to mechanical control com - ponents. At the same time, almost all safety functions involve mechanical control elements, at least where the sensors or actuators of mechanical control compo - nents are concerned that have the function for example of detecting movements or stopping hazardous move - ments. Although it would often be possible for an MTTFD estimated erring on the safe side to be stated for these components, fault exclusion is generally employed in this case. Provided the requirements for the fault exclusion are observed and documented, this is generally the most elegant means of considering the reliability of the mecha - nical components.

D.2.2 BIA-Report 6/2004, “Untersuchung des Alterungsprozesses von hydrau lischen Wegeventilen” (study of the ageing process of hydraulic directional control valves) On hydraulic systems, valves warrant special conside - ration as a “safety-related part of the control system”; valves that control hazardous movements or states, in particular, are extremely important for calculation of 268Annex D the Performance Level. Experience has shown that the failure behaviour of hydraulic valves is characterized less by random failures than by failures due to wear. The causes of such failures are primarily systematic, such as excessive stress, unfavourable conditions of use, or lack of maintenance. In order for the lifetime of hydraulic valves to be estimated better, the IFA (at that time still the BGIA) launched a degree thesis on the subject, the results of which are available in the form of BIA-Report 6/2004, “Untersuchung des Alterungsprozesses von hydraulischen Wegeventilen” [3] (study of the ageing process of hydraulic directional control valves). Since valves that assume control tasks are generally piston-type directional control valves, the MTTFD values for “hydraulic components” were determined on valves of this type. The most important results of this study are presented briefly below. Estimation of an MTTFD value is based in the first instance upon failure rates for hydraulic piston-type directional control valves that were determined in a study conducted in the maintenance departments of two large-scale users of hydraulic equipment (referred to below as users A and B). The failure rates were determined by the evaluation of computer data (quantities of re-ordered hydraulic piston-type directional control valves, repair",

The comparability of the MTTFD values determined for the different users of hydraulic sys - tems is therefore assured. For validation and confirmation of these data, further failure data were collected by a sur - vey of valve manufacturers. In the case of User A, the fail- ure rates for the directional control valves were recorded in the maintenance department of a transmission pro - duction plant. Data were available for all failures of direc - tional control valves over a period of 38 months, during which 143 directional control valves failed. Approximately 8,050 directional control valves of various ages were in use on the machines, for the most part machine tools, in the transmission production plant. If a constant failure rate is assumed during this period, an MTTFD of 178 years can be calculated as the reciprocal of the failure rate from the data for User A. At this user's plant, the operating con - ditions specified by the manufacturers were observed for the most part on the hydraulic systems. Since the facility primarily comprised new production lines, condition- based maintenance was performed. The failure data for the directional control valves at User B's facility were likewise recorded in the maintenance department of a transmission production plant. Appro - ximately 25,000 directional control valves varying in age were in use in this case. Data were available for all direc - tional control valves that had failed over a period of four years (2000 to 2003). In contrast to User A's situation, the failure data for each year were available. It was therefore possible to calculate an MTTFD for each individual year. The MTTFD rose, from 195",

A significant relationship was observed between valve failures and operating/environmental conditions, since the maintenance measures and operating conditions in User B's facility had been improved continually over the years. In addition, the operating conditions were superior to those in User A's plant owing to further measures, such as monitoring of the fluid temperature; larger fluid reser - voirs, generally located outside the machine; finer return line filters; and flue gas discharge systems for reducing the impurities in the ambient atmosphere. The study showed that, in conjunction with the type, quality, and level of contamination of the hydraulic fluid used and the design, material and type of the centering/return spring, the cylindrical guides of the components in valves, e.g. spool valves, had a substantial influence upon the antici - pated lifetime of hydraulic piston-type directional control valves. A clear relationship was also established between the quality of the operating conditions and the attained lifetime to failure over a defined period of observation. D.2.3 MTTFD of hydraulic control components Based upon the results of the above study, an MTTFD of 150 to 1,200 years is proposed in EN ISO 13849-1 for hydraulic components, provided certain conditions are met. The valves studied were primarily of the piston type. Owing to the similarity in failure behaviour, however, the lifetime MTTFD determined for these valves serves as a good estimation for all safety-related hydraulic valves. This is however conditional upon observance during design and manufacture of the basic and well- tried safety principles described in EN ISO 13849-2 for hy draulic valves. The basic and well-tried safety principles for application, likewise described in EN ISO 13849-2, must also be stated by the valve manufacturer (in the manufacturer's data, operating conditions) and observed in practice.

The most impor - tant principles include the use of suitable materials and manufacturing procedures, and the principles of isolation, pressure limitation, protection against unexpected start- up, and a suitable temperature range (for further details, see Annex C). Annex C.3, Table C.2 of EN ISO 13849-2 lists well-tried safety principles for hydraulic systems. The most impor - tant principles comprise overdimensioning/safety factors, speed limitation/reduction by means of a resistance for attainment of a defined volumetric flow, force limita - tion/reduction, an appropriate range for the operating conditions, monitoring of the condition of the pressure medium, the use of well-tried springs, and sufficient over - 269Annex D lap in piston-type valves (for further details, refer again to Annex C). Experience gained through application of the second edi - tion of the standard has shown that for hydraulic valves, the frequency of actuation nop (number of actuations per year, see subclause D.2.4) is also a relevant parameter for the reliability. For this reason, the third edition of the standard states graded MTTFD values of between 150 and 1,200 years for hydraulic valves (see Table D.2) as a function of nop as part of the good engineering practice method (see subclause D.2.5). Even though the standard states MTTFD values for hydrau - lic valves subject to these conditions, each valve manu - facturer should, if at all possible, determine failure stati - stics for his own components and state an MTTFD value of his own.

These include, in particular: • The quality and condition of the pressure medium (compressed air) • Compatibility of seals with the lubricants • Temperature influences • Environmental influences such as dusts, gases, fluids Observance of the requirements specified by the compo - nent manufacturer is crucial, since the parameters for the failure behaviour of the component from which the control system category is calculated are not otherwise valid. A distinction is drawn between contactors and contactor relays. Contactor relays are used to implement logic and to drive contactors. Where higher power ratings must be switched, for example motors > 3 kW, contactors are gene - rally used. Contactor relays are governed by the provisions of IEC 60947-5-1, contactors by those of IEC 60947-4-1. Comprehensive criteria must be observed for their selec - tion and use. These particularly include:• System and operating conditions • Operation functions and conditions • Rate of operations and durability • Protection against over-current and over-temperature • Protection against over-voltage • Special conditions of use The manufacturers provide manuals containing com- prehensive information on selection and engineering. In the context of quantification in accordance with EN ISO 13849, the selection criteria for the lifetime will be considered briefly here. A distinction is drawn between the mechanical and electrical durability. The mechanical durability of a contactor is expressed by the number of operation cycles attained by the contactor without loading of the conducting paths. It is dependent upon the wear of the mechanical moving parts. The electrical durability of switchgear is expressed by the number of operation cycles at the attainment of which the electrical contact",

This causes wear of the contact members in the form of contact pitting. It varies as a function of the voltage, current, load type (e.g. inductive) and dura - tion. Complete contact pitting generally leads to contact welding. In applications relevant to safety, this must be detected, in order for hazardous states caused by failure of the contacts to open to be detected. For detection to be assured, mechanically linked contacts must be used on contactor relays, or mirror contacts on contactors. The manufacturer's information must be observed here. The mechanical durability and the electrical durability of the contact elements are determined by the manufactu- rers in test series. These values are however not indepen - dent of each other. The actual durability of the contactor may depend upon the power and operating mode of the electrical load, as well as upon the mechanical wear. The durability of the device is influenced by these values. The B10D values stated in Table D.2 of this report (see subclause D.2.4.1) for the durability of the device are for orientation only. Preference should be given to the values stated by the manufacturer. Should the manufacturer himself not state a B10D value, but state values (number of operation cycles) for the mechanical and electrical durability, the lower of these values (generally dependent upon the load in the case of the electrical durability) can be used as an estimate of the B10 value.

Since in the case of valves, the “availability” failure criterion also encompasses failures that are not relevant to safety (e.g. leakage above the defined threshold), it has been set out in the standard that the value determined for the nominal life (B10) multiplied by two may be considered equal to the B10D (dangerous) value (number of cycles until 10% of the components fail dangerously): B10D2 ⋅ = (D.2) B10 The B10 value is generally determined in the laboratory. For this purpose, at least seven valves produced at different times are subjected to endurance testing. The maximum rate of operations for the endurance test is determined from the pressure build-up (attainment of 90% of the test pressure) and the pressure dissipation (attainment of 10% of the test pressure) in a connected volume that is defined according to the port cross-subclauses. At least five out of seven valves must fail for evaluation of the test results. The “maximum likelihood” and “rank regression” methods are stated in ISO 19973-1 as example methods for determining the Weibull parameters. As an approximation, where testing is performed on a small number of test specimens, e.g. seven valves, the first failure determines the B10 value, i.e. the number of cycles attained by the time of the first failure corresponds approximately to the B10 value. Should the first failure be dangerous, the number of operation cycles performed up to this point approximates to the B10D value.

This part of the approximation is illustrated in Figure D.3. The unbroken curve represents the original Weibull distri - bution with an assumed shape factor of b = 3. In the parti - cular case where b = 1, the Weibull distribution transitions to an exponential distribution that is characterized by a constant failure rate over time. The dashed line now refers to the exponential distribution corresponding to the “sub - stitute failure rate”, constant over time, which is equal to the reciprocal of the MTTFD value obtained by means of the formula (D.3). The MTTFD obtained by this means ensures that the exponential distribution shown by the dashed line intersects the original Weibull distribution at the point (t = T10D ; FD = 10%). The point at which 10% of the components under analysis have failed dangerously is therefore reached by both distributions following elap - sing of T10D. From Figure D.3, it can be seen that the actual fail ure rate prior to attainment of the wear phase is very low, and remains below the approximated exponential distribution up to point T10D. This approximation is there - fore conservative (on the safe side). The importance of limiting the mission time to T10D is also evident: above this value, the proportion of dangerous failures which may actually be expected rises significantly over time when compared to the exponential substitute function.

It has generally been assumed here that only half of all failures are dangerous. The third edition of the standard however deviated from this rule for “contactors with nominal load”, and the pro - portion of dangerous failures (75% break faults or short- circuits) stated in Table K.2 of the IEC 60947-4-1 product standard [5] was used for conversion. This leads to a reduced B10D value compared to that in the second edition of the standard, namely 1,300,000 rather than 2,000,000 cycles. Consequently, the values stated here may well appear more optimistic than those indicated on manu - facturers' data sheets, which relate to all fault types that could impair functionality in the sense of availability. On some electromechanical components, for example relays, contactor relays and contactors, the electrical load of the contacts is a major factor determining the B10D value, as is frequently confirmed by observations in the field. At low electrical load (typically resistive load), described by EN ISO 13849-1 as up to 20% of the rated value, substan - tially better values are obtained. The mechanical rather than the electrical durability was assumed decisive in this case (see subclause D.2.4). Depending upon the type (resistive or inductive) and magnitude of the load, B10D values lying between the extremes stated here may be derived. For the position switches, guard-locking devices, emergency stop devices and pushbuttons, such as ena - bling switches, listed in the table, the safety principle of direct opening action is generally a requirement for the electrical part. Between the second and third editions of the standard, certain changes took place for these com - ponents in the good",

This topic will therefore be discussed separately in detail in subclauses D.2.5.1 to D.2.5.6 below. By their nature, these approaches constitute major sim- plifications of the actual, complex relationships. A very low load current in particular, combined with infrequent actuation, can for example lead to cold welding of elec - trical contacts. These effects should however be avoided by the required application of basic/well-tried safety prin - ciples. These principles include the suitability of both the mechanical and electrical component characteristics and their adaptation to the anticipated load. D.2.5.1 Modelling of electromechanical compo - nents (position switches, guard-locking devices, emergency stop devices, enab - ling switches and pushbuttons) It has been seen in practical application of the standard to date that considerable uncertainty exists regarding the modelling of electromechanical components. This can also be seen from the fact that the language between the two parts of the standard differs to some extent in this context: whereas the first part selects an approach invol - ving B10D within the good engineering practice method (see Table D.2), the second part addresses possible fault exclusions. This is exacerbated by the fact that for many of these components, a clear distinction cannot be made between their mechanical and electrical parts. Conse - quently, the requirements and information in both parts of the standard will first be presented below in general terms; a pragmatic modelling approach will then be pro - posed for the various electromechanical components that draws primarily upon Part 1 of the standard. Part 2 can also be applied as an alternative; implementation often fails in practice however owing to the fact that complete fault exclusion for the mechanical and electrical part requires confirmation by the manufacturer –",

What is stated in the standard? – Electro mechanical components in accordance with Part 1 of the standard With the good engineering practice method introduced above, EN ISO 13849-1:2015 proposes that subject to satisfaction of the conditions set out below, the typi - cal B10D values [S] for position switches, guard-locking devices, emergency stop devices, enabling switches and pushbuttons stated in Table D.2 may be assumed: • Use of basic and well-tried safety principles in design, application and operation of the component (see Tables D.1 and D.2 to EN ISO 13849-2), and 275Annex D • The possibility of fault exclusion for direct opening action (contacts to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K, characte - rized in the conceptual circuit diagrams by →) Manufacturer's data [M] should of course always be given preference over typical values stated in the standard. Regarding modelling, the standard states that the compo - nents “ can be estimated as a Category 1 or Category 3/4 subsystem depending on the number of electrical output contacts and on the fault detection in the subsequent SRP/CS. Each contact element (including the mechanical actuation) can be considered as one channel with a res - pective B10D value. ” Although this statement refers directly only to emergency stop devices and enabling switches, the principle can also be applied to other electromechanical components. It appears at first glance inconsistent for single-channel or two-channel modelling to be determined by the num - ber of electrical output contacts, despite the fact that fault exclusion for direct opening action can be assumed for mechanically linked contact elements. However, the statement that the B10D value of each channel is to apply to the",

The focus lay here not upon the details of the electromechanical design, but upon a recipe that is as simple as possible: • An electromechanical component employing one con - tact element with direct opening action that satisfies the above conditions can be modelled as part of a Cate - gory 1 subsystem. In the functional channel, the subsys - tem contains a block with the corresponding B10D value. • An electromechanical component employing (at least) two contact elements with direct opening action that satisfies the above conditions can be modelled as part of a Category 3 or 4 subsystem, depending upon fault detection in the downstream SRP/CS. In each of the two functional channels, the subsystem contains one block with the corresponding B10D value. Beyond the general case, EN ISO 13849-1 adds that “ in some cases it may be possible, that the machine builder can apply a fault exclusion according to EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.8 considering the specific application and envi - ronmental conditions of the device. ”. The formulation of fault exclusion for an electromechanical component is therefore on the one hand an issue for the component manufacturer, who alone is familiar with the detail of its mechanical design. At the same time, it must be consi- dered with respect to the application whether fault exclu - sion is permissible in consideration of ambient, operating and application aspects.

Versions of these pushbuttons with one make contact are suitable for use up to PL c, two- channel versions up to PL d. D.2.6 MTTFD of electronic control components As already mentioned, declaration of the failure rates λ and λD, for example in the form of FIT values (failures in time, i.e. failures in 109 component hours), has long been normal practice for electronic components. It is therefore very likely that reliability information can be obtained from the manufacturer. These data may possibly have to be converted to MTTFD values, for example with the aid of the simplifying assumption that only 50% of all failures are dangerous. If manufacturers' data are not available, reference can be made to a number of known data bases.

In the majority of databases, electronic components are catalogued by component type and other criteria (e.g. design, material, enclosure). Generally, base failure rates are stated in the first instance for reference conditions (e.g. for a compo - nent ambient temperature of 40 °C and nominal load). Where the actual conditions of use differ, these rates can be corrected by means of adjustment factors. Tables C.2 to C.7 of the standard even list values taken from the SN 29500 database for certain typical electronic compo - nents. In the third edition of the standard however, the columns present in the previous version, in which a safety margin of 10 (worst case) was implied, have been deleted. Provided the data sources are applied correctly, an additi - onal safety factor is not generally required. Adjustment to stresses outside the reference conditions is not explicitly required by the standard, and should be applied with a sense of proportion in the interests of simplicity. D.3 Integration of components and equip- ment that have already been certified Manufacturers are increasingly stating an MTTFD for their components on the data sheet.

Should such components be employed in one channel of the SRP/CS only, the stated probability of failure per hour ( PFHD) may be considered as a substitute for the rate of dangerous failure (see formula D.6). Internal component characteristics such as redun - dancy and self-diagnostics are already considered in this case. More detailed information on this aspect can be found in Chapter 2 of SISTEMA Cookbook 4 [9]. PFHMTTFD1 1≈ = λD(D.6) (“Black -Box” components with PF HD within one channel )D D.4 Parts count method Once the MTTFD values of all safety-related components are known, the MTTFD of each block must first be calcula - ted from them. This step can be performed in close detail by an FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis, Annex B); ideally, however, the different failure modes of each safety-related component and their effect upon the block must be analysed for this purpose. In consideration of the effort, this approach is therefore generally worthwhile only for components with a high failure rate, i.e. a low MTTFD value. An alternative that can be performed quickly and yields values that on average are not appreciably poorer is the parts count method stated in EN ISO 13849, Part 1. Essentially, this method is a summation with two chief assumptions: • Irrespective of the failure mode of a component and its effects upon the block, all failures are divided into two halves, safe and dangerous. This means that half of the 282Annex D failure rate λ of a component contributes to the dange - rous failure rate λD of the associated block. If the propor - tion of dangerous failures, λD, within the failure rate as a whole has already been determined",

Based upon this relationship, the MTTFD value of a block can easily be derived from the MTTFD values of its com - ponents. An example of application of the parts count method can be found in Chapter 6. D.5 Series arrangement of blocks in a channel and capping of the MTTFD If MTTFD values or λD failure rates are available for each block, the MTTFD for each channel can also be calculated in accordance with formula (D.7) by summation of the fail- ure rates of all blocks involved in a channel. It is assumed in this case that the dangerous failure of any block in the chain of blocks constituting a channel is also to be treated as a dangerous failure of the channel. Since under certain circumstances however, downstream blocks are capable of detecting a dangerous failure of upstream blocks, this assumption constitutes an estimation erring on the safe side. The capping rule of the standard takes effect in this phase of determining the MTTFD: with the exception of Category 4, each MTTFD of a channel that mathematically exceeds 100 years is routinely reduced to the maximum value of 100 years. In Category 4, the cap is 2,500 years. The purpose of this rule is to",

D.6 Symmetrization of multiple channels As soon as a control system involves two channels (as is generally the case for Categories 3 and 4) exhibiting different MTTFD values, the question arises as to which of the MTTFD values for each channel is to be used for deter - mining the PL with the aid of the bar chart. For this issue, too, EN ISO 13849-1 has the answer in the form of a simple formula:/uni239F/uni239F/uni239F/uni239F /uni23A0/uni239E /uni239C/uni239C/uni239C/uni239C /uni239D/uni239B +− + =1 11 32 MTTFDC2MTTFDC1MTTFDC2MTTFDC1MTTFD(D.8) The average MTTFD per channel is thus produced from the MTTFD values of the two redundant channels C1 and C2 by means of an averaging formula (this formula can be deri - ved mathematically by calculation of the MTTFD value for a two-channel system without diagnostics but with known MTTFD values of both channels – MTTFDC1 and MTTFDC2 [5]). This completes the successive grouping of the MTTFD values of all components involved in the control system. The result is a value for the typical reliability of the com - ponents present in the control system, without conside - ration of the redundancy, diagnostics or CCF (common cause failures, cf. Annex F). Given that the MTTFD is already capped to 100 years (2,500 years in the case of Category 4) for each channel involved, assignment of the MTTFD values to one of the three classes, “low”, “medium” or “high”, is expedient only after symmetrization. The sym - metrized value is substituted in the numerical calculation of the PL as a parameter in addition to the Category, the average diagnostic coverage and the measures against common cause failure.",

It may relate to individual components, blocks, or entire subsystems ( DCavg). The precise definition of the DC is based upon the division of failures into three groups (see Figure E.1): • Safe (S) failures: these failures automatically result in a safe state being assumed that does not give rise to any hazards (example: a contactor remaining open or a valve remaining closed, resulting in interruption of energy and consequently stopping of potentially hazar - dous movements). • Dangerous detectable (DD) failures: these potentially dangerous failures are detected by test or monitoring measures and transferred to a safe state (example: fail- ure of a contactor to open or of a valve to close, which is detected by a readback contact or position monitor, and handled safely). • Dangerous undetectable (DU) failures: these potentially dangerous failures are not detected (example: undetec - ted failure of a contactor to open or of a valve",

The diagnostic coverage ( DC) is determined by the pro - portion of detectable dangerous failures (DD) among all dangerous failures (D), and is generally stated as a per - centage. For calculation of the DC, for example in conjunc - tion with an FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis, see Annex B), the ratio is calculated of the totals of the failure rates λDD and λD of the unit under consideration. The DC is seen here to be a value relating to the tested unit (e.g. the block) and not to the test equipment. In order to simplify calculation of the DC, EN ISO 13849-1 offers an alternative solution to the FMEA: it proposes DC key values for typi - cal diagnostics measures, the attainment of which may be assumed when the relevant measure is implemented correctly. In this way, evaluation from tables of the dia - gnostics measures implemented per unit is sufficient. A similar procedure is frequently used by test bodies as standard and economic practice. Since the proportion of dangerous undetectable failures (i.e. 1 – DC) is the relevant value for the probability of failure for evaluation of the implemented",

The formation of groups by means of the key values is applied here both for qualification of the individual tests, and for definition of the DCavg. Since DCavg is one of the input variables for the simplified bar-chart method for quantification of the probability of failure, the calculated DCavg value is rounded down to the next lowest of the four key values (0, 60, 90 and 99%) from Table E.1, and thereby placed in one of the four DC classes (None, Low, Medium and High). For example, a DCavg value of 80% is reduced in the simplified approach to a value of 60% (in contrast to the procedure in the IFA SISTEMA software utility, which employs intermediate DCavg values in its default setting; see Annex H).

It is also important that the safe state is actually assumed following detection of a dangerous failure. If, for example, contact welding on a main contactor is detected, but no means exist for timely stopping of a hazardous move - ment, the detection is useless and must be rated with a DC of 0%. With regard to the DC measure of “fault detection by the process”, the third edition of the standard provides information in the form of examples: “ The DC measure ‘fault detection by the process’ may only be applied if the safety-related component is involved in the production process, e.g. a standard PLC or standard sensors are used for workpiece processing and as part of one or two redundant functional channels executing the safety func - tion. The appropriate DC level depends on the overlap of the commonly used resources (logic, inputs/outputs etc.). E.g. when all faults of a rotary encoder on a printing machine lead to highly visible interruption of the printing process, the DC for this sensor used to monitor a safely limited speed may be estimated as 90% up to 99%. ” For PLr = e, this measure is not sufficient on its own (see Table E.2), and produces a red warning message when SISTEMA is used. Where adequately justified however, for example by means of further DC measures acting upon the same block, or when the complementary block of the redundant channel implements a different DC measure with a DC at least as great as the assumed DC provided by the process, this measure may still be included in the analysis.

Measures other than those stated in Table E.2 may also be employed. Further information on determining the DC for typical test measures can be found for example in Tables A.2 to A.14 of IEC 61508-2 [1]. These tables contain the key values of 60, 90 and 99% as the maximum DC to be attained by the relevant measure. With suitable unrestricted implemen - tation of the measures stated, this maximum value can however generally be employed for estimation. Annex E of EN ISO 13849-2 [2] describes a comprehensive example of validation of the failure behaviour and the diagnostic measures on an automatic assembly machine. Following determining of the DC for individual test meas- ures and prior to calculation of the DCavg, the DC value per block must be determined. An individual test measure generally acts upon an entire block (e.g. cross monito - ring): the discrete value can then simply be adopted for the block. Further permutations exist, however: • If a block is monitored by a number of individual meas- ures (see Figure E.2), the block DC is at least as good as the best individual DC. Should the measures mutually complement each other, a higher block DC may even be possible; this DC however must then be determined",

(Whether the occurrence of units without testing is permissible must be determined with reference to the relevant Category definition, see subclauses 6.2.5 to 6.2.7; the DC for the logic is subject to further requirements, see above.) A better and more precise value for the block DC can be attained by weighting the individual DC value with the associated failure rate λD (= 1/ MTTFD). Formula (E.1) can also be used for this purpose as an averaging formula at block level. Depending upon the accuracy, such an ana - lysis also ultimately leads to an FMEA, however. • Where components are cascaded, such as electro - mechanical position switches connected to a safety module by a common conductor, it may lead to a reduc - tion in the DC. An electrically two-channel arrangement enables certain faults of a position switch to be detec - ted by the safety module from logically implausible signals from the two electrical contacts. Starting of the machine for example is prevented following closing of the door on which the switch is defective. If, in addition to the door on which the position switch has failed dangerously, a further door is opened, fault detection is (depending upon the sequence) not possible.

Consequently, several channels must fail before the impairment of a test becomes relevant to the system, which is very unlikely as long as the test cycles continue to be much smaller than the MTTFD of a channel. Subclause 6.2.14 provides more comprehensive expla - nations concerning the required test rate. In Category 2 structures however, failure of the test equipment turns a single-channel tested system into a single-channel untes - ted system. The next dangerous failure in the functional channel can then no longer be detected and leads directly to performance of the safety function no longer being possible. In addition to requirements for the DC, further 292Annex E conditions therefore apply for the simplified assessment of the probability of failure of Category 2 systems: • All test rates must be at least 100 times (in exceptional cases, at least 25 times) greater than the demand rate upon the safety function; alternatively, in the event of testing immediately upon demand of the safety func - tion, testing should be performed so quickly that the safe state is reached before a hazard arises. This is to ensure that a failure can be detected by a test before a demand of the safety function cannot be met (see also Annex G). • The MTTFD of the test channel (TE and OTE) must be at least half as high as the MTTFD of the functional channel (I, L and O). This assumption ensures that the probability of failure of the test channel is not unac - ceptably high.

The desired single-fault tolerance of a redundant structure is thus negated. It is therefore important that this source of faults be elimina - ted as far as possible. The triggers of CCFs may be physical in nature, such as overtemperature or strong electromag - netic interference, or systematic, such as defective circuit design or programming errors where identical software is employed for both channels. A common strategy for quantification of a control system's susceptibility to CCF is the beta-factor model. This stra- tegy assumes that a certain proportion of the dangerous failures in one channel share the same cause as dange - rous failures in the second channel.

Simplification is based upon technical measures that experts have considered particularly useful for the avoidance of CCF. This is, however, a compromise that can be justified empirically, but not scientifically: • The list of measures against CCF was focused upon the relevant solutions, primarily technical in nature, in machine safety. • A single target value with a maximum of 2% was selec - ted instead of several possible β values.

Firstly, the standard limits the number of designated architectures and therefore also the number of necessary models. Secondly, the large number of input parameters has been reduced by intelligent grouping. For this purpose, the values MTTFD and DCavg were introduced, each of which groups several input parameters. The MTTFD used in the diagram represents a mean time to failure of each channel in its dangerous failure mode. The MTTFD values of several function blocks are grouped here to form a single channel MTTFD (Chapter 6 and Annex D). All MTTFD values are based upon the assumption of con - stant component failure rates λD, hence MTTFD = 1/λD.

Where demands are made continually upon the safety function (continuous mode of operation), it indicates the number of dangerous system failures per hour. For Category 2, a requirement is that testing is fully effective. This can be attained by an adequate relationship between the test and demand rate or by an adequately fast response to a fault (cf. subclause 6.2.14). Since the PFHD determined in this way considers only random failures and not systematic failures and other negative effects, it must be regarded as a theoretical per - formance value that denotes the safety quality of a design but does not permit conclusions for example regarding the frequency of accidents. This PFHD is the mathematical quantity indicated on the vertical axis of the bar chart (cf. Figure G.1). Despite consideration being given in principle to demands upon the safety function and to repair, the absolute values for the demand rate and the repair rate (the reciprocal of the repair time) have only a negligibly small influence upon the PFHD in this sense. Only for the designated architecture for Category 2 must testing at a frequency substantially higher than that of the demand of the safety function be made a requirement (alterna - tively: testing takes place immediately upon demand and the times",

The standard proposes a test rate that is at least 100 times that of the demand rate. Even down to a ratio of 25 : 1, however, the PFHD increases only by approximately 10%, which can be allowed for by a correction factor of 1.1 (cf. Note 1 in Annex K of the standard). This ratio in the rates avoids an unacceptably high impairment of diagnostics caused 297Annex G by insuffi ciently frequent performance of the test. For the Categories B, 1, 3 and 4, the influence of the demand rate upon the PFHD is negligibly low. The PFHD values deter - mined from the diagram for the Categories B, 1, 3 and 4 therefore apply to any demand rates and any (mean) repair times. For values of less than one demand per year, the bar chart provides an estimation erring on the safe side. For Categories 3 and 4, the PFHD values are valid for adequately high test frequencies (see explanations in subclause 6.2.14). Should the mission time of an SRP/CS exceed 20 years, the PFHD values determined by means of the simplified method (Annex K of the standard) are generally no longer valid. Under certain circumstances, this situation can however be addressed within the simplified procedure with a few improvements. Two possible scenarios exist: • In the first scenario, the SRP/CS is specified from the outset for a mission time exceeding 20 years. The influ - ence of the longer mission time can then be estimated erring on the safe side from the Markov models upon which Annex K of the standard is based, as follows: for every five years' extension of the mission time beyond 20",

The simplified method and SISTEMA can therefore still be used. This is conditional upon constant failure rates, irrespective of the mission time. For parts subject to wear, this means that the parts must be designed for the specified longer mission time TM (T10D ≥ TM), or each part must be replaced preventively upon expiration of T10D. • In the second case, the SRP/CS was originally designed for a mission time of 20 years, but is now to be used beyond this duration. The deterioration in the PFHD anticipated from the Markov modelling can then be esti- mated as described in the first case with addition of an allowance. The situation is critical where the SRP/CS contains wearing parts or components that deteriorate over age; these typically include “chemical” components (e.g. “wet” electrolytic capacitors, batte - ries, electrochemical sensors), mechanical components (such as brakes, clutches), electromechanical compo - nents (such as switches, relays, contactors), fluid power components (such as valves), and certain optical com - ponents (such as optocouplers). In this case, the user of the machine (operating party) is generally unable to assess whether all its components are also designed for an extended mission time, or what measures, such as preventive replacement of individual parts, proof tes - ting, etc., must be performed. Extension of the mission time – with addition of the allowance stated above to the PFHD – is possible only when manufacturer's infor - mation is available on the measures to be taken when the mission time is extended, and only conditional upon these measures being implemented by the user (operating party).

The PFHD values for these Categories can however be approximated very well by the simple relationship PFHD ≈ λD = 1/ MTTFD. This means simply that the PFHD of the single-channel un tested system ( DCavg = 0) corresponds practically to its dangerous failure rate. For the other Categories, however, a more complex me thod of calculation is required.

Block L tests blocks I, O and itself in conjunction with the function block TE (test equipment). The function block OTE (output of TE) is capable of initiating a safe state in the event of failure of the main I-L-O channel. The additional function blocks TE and OTE, which are not directly essential to the function, thus constitute a form of substitute channel for the fault case. Unlike a “true” second channel, this sub stitute channel becomes active only when faults are detected in the main channel.

Failures of function blocks cause consequential states to be reached, indicated here by arrows. States in which the system is no longer capable of performing the safety func - tion are shown in grey. In cases where the failure can be detected and a safe response is therefore possible, a tran - sition exists to the “Operating inhibition” state shown on the left-hand side. Of the 32 failure combinations, those in which the system has failed dangerously and undetec - tably (to itself) are grouped together for simplification of the model. This collective state, denoted “System DU” (dangerous undetectable), is shown on the right. It can be attained from several states as a consequence of the fail- ure of function blocks. The “Hazardous situation/harm” state can be seen at the bottom of Figure G.3.

The columns are created by variation of the MTTFD, i.e. the mean time to dangerous failure of the (or a) functional channel, for a combination of the architecture (or the associated Markov model) and the DCavg. The Markov model in Figure G.3 can for example be used to calculate the two columns for the designated Category 2 architecture.

This model is not presented here, since its relationship to the block diagram in Figure G.2 is less transparent. The substitute model delivers virtually iden - tical results.)

The assignment of PFHD intervals and Performance Levels is largely consistent with IEC 61508-1, Table 3, and IEC 61508-5, Figure E.2 (see [3; 4]).Annex K of the standard contains the content of Figure G.1 in numerical form in Table K.1. Table K.1 can be used to determine the Performance Level more precisely than is possible by means of the figure; this is particularly useful when the PFHD contributions of several cascaded subsystems require summation. Conversely, the bar chart pro vides, above all, a swift overview of the suitability of various technical solutions for the PL, and can therefore be used to make a preliminary selection. The information in Table K.1 of the standard is also contained in the “Per - formance Level Calculator” (PLC), a convenient card disc available from the IFA that can be used to determine the PL [5]. Occasionally, the DCavg value determined for a system may lie only marginally below one of the thresholds “low” (60%), “medium” (90%) or “high” (99%). If the simplified quantification method in EN ISO 13849-1 is then applied, purely formal constraints require that the next-lower DCavg level, i.e. “none”, “low” or “medium”, be used. This pro - cedure constitutes an estimation of the system erring on the safe side. Owing to the small number of graduations on the DCavg scale, however, a minor change to the system that has the effect of causing the DCavg value to dip just below one of the thresholds may result in a substantially poorer assessment of the system. This can even occur when components with high-quality testing (a high DC) in a channel are",

The minor improvement in the channel MTTFD is then over-compensated for by the formal down - grading of the DCavg to the next lower level, as a result of which a poorer (i.e. greater) PFHD value is determined. This effect, which appears paradoxical, is a consequence of the coarse division of the DCavg scale, i.e. ultimately of the simplicity of Figure 5 (Table K.1) of the standard (cf. Figure G.1 of this report). This effect can be prevented or ameliorated by use of a graph with a finer scale for the DCavg values (Figure G.4) in place of Figure G.1. In consideration of the limited accuracy of DCavg values (cf. EN ISO 13849-1, Table 6, Note 2), the minimum possible DCavg values were also considered for all Categories. The IFA “SISTEMA” software utility (see Annex H) can be used to determine the PFHD. SISTEMA even interpolates between the columns shown in Figure G.4.

The tool, which runs on Windows, enables the structure of the SRP/CS to be modelled based upon “designated architectures”, and ultimately permits automated calculation of the reli - ability values at various levels of detail, including that of the attained Performance Level (PL) and the probability of failure ( PFHD).

Once the required data have been entered into SISTEMA, the results are calculated and displayed virtually instantly: each parameter change is reflected immediately on the user interface with its impact upon the entire system. Users are for the most part spared time-consuming consultation of tables and calculation using formulae (calculation of the MTTFD by means of the parts count method, symmetrization of the MTTFD for each channel, estimation of the DCavg, calculation of the PFHD and PL, etc.), since these tasks are performed by the software. This enables parameter values to be varied and effects of the changes assessed with little effort. The final results are summarized in a report, which can be printed out. H.2 How is SISTEMA used? SISTEMA processes basic elements from a total of six hierarchical levels: the project (PR), the safety function (SF), the subsystem (SB), the channel (CH)/test channel (TE), the block (BL) and the element (EL). The relationship between them is shown briefly below (Figure H.1). The user first opens a project, in which the machine or hazard zone that is to be analysed in greater detail can be defined. Safety functions are then assigned to the project. The safety functions can be defined and documented, and a PLr assigned to them. The PL actually attained by the parameterized SRP/CS is determined automatically from the subsystems which – in a series arrangement – execute the safety function. Each subsystem is based upon a “designated architecture” from the standard, as a function of the selected Category. The architecture deter - mines, among other things, whether the control system is of single-channel, single-channel tested or redundant design, and whether a special test channel must be consi - dered during evaluation. Each channel",

The greatest part of the user interface is occupied by the workspace in the centre. Depending upon which view is active, the workspace contains an editable input dialog or a partial view of the overview document. The content of the active view is determined by the basic element selected from the hierarchy described above, which is selected from a tree view on the left-hand side. Each branch in the tree view represents one basic ele - ment. Basic elements can be created, deleted, moved or copied on different levels in the tree view. The details of the selected basic element are entered in the input dia -log in the editing view. Each input dialog is further sub- divided into different areas by tabs.

Since such intervention, required for example for setup, troubleshooting or cleaning, is generally associated with an elevated risk, different operating modes are employed depending upon the task to be performed. Selection of an operating mode activates safety functions on the machine that reduce the respective prevailing risk to an acceptable level. From a safety perspective, an ope - rating mode is thus defined in terms of the safety func - tions that are activated and those that are deactivated when the operating mode is selected. Errors in selection of the operating mode may lead to the required safety functions not being activated: if a different operating mode is activated to that selected, other safety functions are activated rather than those required for the planned task. In the worst-case scenario, an error in operating mode selection may even lead to no safety functions at all being active. The increase in the risk associated with the two cases necessitates a safety analysis of the operating mode selection. Operating mode selection is normally implemented by electromechanical selector switches. The Machinery Directive [1] sets out a number of requirements for this purpose. For",

The use of electronic equipment for this purpose is not excluded; the circuits and components used that are relevant to safety, and any software that may be used, must however attain a level of safety comparable to that of an electro- mechanical operating mode selector switch. Since an error in selection of the operating mode may lead to a direct increase in the risk, selection of the ope - rating mode must be regarded as a safety-related func - tion. It is also listed as such in Table 8 of the standard. This raises the question whether the control aspect of operating mode selection is part of each safety function implemented on the machine, or whether operating mode selection can be regarded as a safety function in its own right. As in the procedure described in subclause 5.3.2, in which overlapping hazards within a given danger zone can be divided into hazards presented by individual parts of the machine, it is expedient for operating mode selec - tion to be treated as a safety function in its own right. This also prevents the components used for operating mode selection from further increasing the",

As stated in the introduction, an operating mode is cha - racterized in safety terms by the safety functions that are activated by its selection. Accordingly, the safety function of operating mode selection can be defined as follows: activation of the safety functions required for the selected operating mode. It must now be determined how the required Performance Level PLr of the operating mode selection function is to be set. In some cases, the PLr of operating mode selection is already stated in the product standard used. Where this is not the case, it is logical for the highest PLr of all safety functions that can be activated on the machine to be applied. This rule is based upon the fact that failure of the operating mode selection function can result in the required safety functions not being activated, or – in a worst-case scenario, when operating mode selection fails altogether – the machine being operated unnoticed with no safety functions whatsoever. When a machine tool is changed from the “setup” to the “process monito - ring” operating mode, for example, this could lead to an un acceptable increase in the risk. When operating mode selection is treated as a safety function in the sense of EN ISO 13849-1, the standard also becomes relevant for evaluation of the control technology employed. Depending upon the components used and the scenario, fault exclusions could be asserted. This pro - cedure will be described below for common control ele - ments used for operating mode selection.

These switches also have the status of well-tried components; the safety function can therefore be classified as Category 1 in accordance with the standard when they are used. If, on switches with direct opening contact elements, the fault exclusions are also possible for short circuit between adjacent isolated contacts and for simultaneous short cir - cuit between the three terminals of changeover contacts in accordance with Table D.8 of EN ISO 13849-2, these component faults need not be assumed. For example, on a two-channel electrical circuit, fault exclusion permits modelling as a Category 3 subsystem and implementation up to Performance Level PL d in the single-channel mecha - nical components (refer in this context also in IFA Report 4/2018e, Annex A, Example 8 [2]). Fault exclusions cannot be asserted for PL e; additional measures are required in this case. It is possible for example for the operator of the machine to be required to confirm the selected operating mode following display on a user interface. At the same time, an activation system (see subclause I.3) in the safety-related control in PL e is to ensure that at any given time, no more and no less than one operating mode is selected on the machine. I.3 Electronic equipment Fault exclusion is not possible on electronic equipment. A further analysis is therefore required for fault analysis of operating mode selection by means of electronic equip - ment.

Since selection of each operating mode is associ - ated with the activation of different safety functions, the access system is considered relevant to safety. On electromechanical selection equipment, access is implemented by means of a key. Mechanical coding of the key can be used to limit the selection to specific operating modes. This measure is accompanied by organizational measures that have the purpose of limiting access to the key(s) to certain groups of persons. On electronic selection equipment, access can be imple - mented for example by means of an RFID (radio-frequency identification) key or by passwords and corresponding organizational measures. For analysis of the safety, assessment is necessary of whether the access restric - tions exhibit safety comparable to that provided by a key on electromechanical selection equipment (integrity of the access data, coding, copy protection, organizational measures, etc.). The access system does not therefore need to be considered during determining of the probabi - lity of failure of the safety function.

As described above, fault exclusion permits safety implementation up to PL d and with the application of additional measures up to PL e on such equipment. On electronic selection equipment, the selection system is generally implemented by means of a user interface (human-machine interface, HMI), for example employing a touchpad or membrane keyboard. The operator specifies the operating mode to be activated in the machine control 307Annex I through the user interface and where applicable further electronic components. Since standard components are generally employed for this purpose, classification of a selection system engineered in this way as PL c or higher is not generally possible in the first instance. One means by which the required safety can nevertheless be attained is described in subclause 4.6.4 of the standard, which states provisions concerning software-based parameteri - zation. Since selection of the operating mode by an elec - tronic selection system is equivalent to software-based parameterization, the safety of this selection system can be assessed against this subclause of the standard. The method described in subclause 4.6.4 encompasses selection of the operating mode by the operator, checking of the selected operating mode in the safe control sys - tem, and confirmation of the selected operating mode by the operator. This ensures that the integrity of the data used for parameterization is maintained along the entire communication chain and that corruption is detected. In particular, should a fault occur in one of the components of the selection equipment, it is prevented from selecting or confirming an incorrect operating mode.

The authorization level defines, as a function of the technical qualifications of the operator, which operating modes the operator is to be entitled to select. The reader is connected to the standard PLC through a data interface. Once the key data have been read out, the authorization level is transmitted to the HMI (a) and the safety PLC (b).

This means that a single fault can - not lead simultaneously to an incorrect output on the data interface and the relay output. Single faults are detected by high-quality coding of the authorization level, cross monitoring in the reader, and anticipation in the safety PLC.

The process described for selection, checking and confir - mation of the operating mode and programming of this process satisfy the requirements for software-based para - meterization in accordance with subclause 4.6.4 of the standard. The SRASW software of the safety PLC is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL e and the guidance in subclause 6.3. The safety PLC is a safety component for use in PL e.

Contents 1 Current situation 2 Handling of overlapping hazards in practice 1 Current situation The analysis of discrete hazards is proven good practice in safety technology. Probabilistic analysis in accordance with EN ISO 13849-­‐1 or IEC 61508 [3, 4] and IEC 62061 and the risk assessment for a hazard situation show however that consideration must also be given to the overlap of hazards. The paper [5] provides a basis for discussion of the consequences of a probabilistic approach to the analysis of overlapping hazards. The present information sheet details and elaborates upon this paper. Owing to th e wide range of hazardous situations encountered at the human -­‐machine interfaces referred to above, this information sheet cannot be considered universally valid for their analysis. Standards developers are free to describe appropriate machine-­‐ specific pro visions in the relevant product or Type C standards and have the remit to do so. Problematic in this context is that where a large number of overlapping hazards arise at a human -­‐ machine interface, a sufficiently low probability of failure of all safety -­‐related control components involved (sensors, logic, multiple actuators) can be demonstrated only with very high analytical effort (e.g. Markov modelling), if at all. Furthermore, overlapping hazards of differing risk (differing in their PL r or SIL) make dete rmining the probability of failure of safety functions more complex,",

However, where several actuators (e.g. contactors, valves, closed-loop drive controls) contribute to reducing the risk of the same discrete hazard, they must all be considered together in a safety function. In other words, all actuators capable of causing hazardous movements on one and the same machine part must be considered together in a safety function.

Multiple chucks that together hold an item (where a failure of one of the chucks results in the item no lon - ger being held) must be grouped in a safety function. With reference to Example 1, formulation of safety func - tions from the discrete analysis can result in the analysis of the hazards presented by the drive axes as shown in Figure 2.

MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 2Chapter 1: Regulations EU Directives and Legislation The purpose of this section is to act as a guide for anyone concerned with machine safety especially guarding and protective systems in the European Union. It is intended for designers and users of industrial equipment. In order to promote the concept of an open market within the European Economic Area (EEA) (which comprises all EU Member States plus three other countries) all member states are obliged to enact legislation that de ﬁ nes essential safety requirements for machinery and its use. Machinery that does not meet these requirements cannot be supplied into or within EEA countries. There are several European Directives that can apply to the safety of industrial machinery and equipment but the two that are of the most direct relevance are: 1 The Machinery Directive2 The Use of Work Equipment by Workers at Work DirectiveThese two Directives are directly related as the Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs) from the Machinery Directive can be used to con ﬁ rm the safety of equipment in the Use of Work Equipment Directive. This section deals with aspects of both directives and it is strongly recommended that",

    "text": "anyone concerned with the design, supply, purchase or use of industrial equipment within or into the EEA and also certain other European countries should familiarize themselves with their requirements. Most suppliers and users of machinery will simply not be allowed to supply or operate machinery in these countries unless they conform to these directives. There are other European Directives that may have relevance to machinery. Most of them are fairly specialized in their application and are therefore left outside the scope of this section but it is important to note that, where relevant, their requirements must also be met. Examples are: The EMC Directive 2014/30/EC and the ATEX Directive 2014/34/EU. 3MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Regulations The Machinery Directive The Machinery Directive covers the supply of new machinery and other equipment including safety components. It is an offense to supply machinery within the EU unless the provisions and requirements of the Directive are met. The broadest de ﬁ nition of “machinery” given within the Directive is a follows: an assembly, ﬁ tted with or intended to be ﬁ tted with a drive system other than directly applied human or animal effort, consisting of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves, and which are joined together for a speci ﬁ c application The current Machinery Directive (2006/42/EC) replaced the former version (98/37/EC) at the end of 2009. It clariﬁ es and amends but does not introduce any radical changes to its Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs). It does introduce some changes to take account of changes in technology and methods. It extends its scope to cover some extra types of equipment (e.g. construction site hoists). There is now an explicit requirement for a risk assessment for the determination of which EHSRs are applicable and there are changes made",

The provisions of the current Directive (2006/42/EC) became applicable on December 29, 2009. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer or his authorized representative to ensure that equipment supplied is in conformity with the Directive. This includes: • Ensuring that the applicable EHSRs contained in Annex I of the Directive are ful ﬁ lled • A technical ﬁ le is prepared • Appropriate conformity assessment is carried out • An “EC Declaration of Conformity” is given• CE Marking is afﬁ xed where applicable • Instructions for safe use are providedCE marking afﬁ xed to machine MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 4Essential Health & Safety Requirements Annex 1 of the Directive gives a list of Essential Health and Safety Requirements (referred to as EHSRs) to which machinery must comply where relevant. The purpose of this list is to ensure that the machinery is safe and is designed and constructed so that it can be used, adjusted and maintained throughout all phases of its life without putting persons at risk. The following text provides a quick overview of some typical requirements but it is important to consider all of the EHSRs given in Annex 1. A risk assessment must be carried out to determine which EHSRs are applicable to the equipment under consideration. The EHSRs in Annex 1 provides a hierarchy of measures for eliminating the risk:(1) Inherently Safe Design. Where possible the design itself will prevent",

This ﬁ le should include all relevant information such as test results, drawings, speci ﬁ cations, etc. A harmonized European (EN) Standard that is listed in the Ofﬁ cial Journal of the European Union (OJ) under the Machinery Directive, and whose date of cessation of presumption of conformity has not expired, confers a presumption of conformity with certain of the EHSR’s. (Many recent standards listed in the OJ include a cross-reference identifying the EHSR’s that are covered by the standard). Therefore, where equipment complies with such current harmonized European standards, the task of demonstrating conformity with the EHSR’s is greatly simpli ﬁ ed, and the manufacturer also bene ﬁ ts from the increased legal certainty. These standards are not legally required, however, their use is strongly recommended since proving conformity by alternative methods can be an extremely complex issue. These standards support the Machinery Directive and are produced by CEN (the European Committee for Standardization) in cooperation with ISO, and CENELEC (the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) in cooperation with IEC. A thorough, documented risk assessment must be conducted to ensure that all potential machine hazards are addressed.

New machinery (and second hand machinery from outside the EU) provided after January 1, 1993 should satisfy any relevant product directives, e.g., The Machinery Directive (subject to transitional arrangements). Second hand equipment from within the EU provided for the ﬁ rst time in the workplace must immediately provide minimum requirements given in an annex of the U.W.E. Directive. Note: Existing or second-hand machinery which is signi ﬁ cantly overhauled or modi ﬁ ed will be classi ﬁ ed as new equipment, so the work carried out on it must ensure compliance with the Machinery Directive (even if it is for a company’s own use). Suitability of work equipment is an important requirement of the directive and it highlights the employer’s responsibility to carry out a proper process of risk assessment. It is a requirement that machinery must be properly maintained. This will normally mean that there must be a routine and planned preventive maintenance schedule. It is recommended that a log is compiled and kept up to date. This is especially important in cases where the maintenance and inspection of equipment contributes to the continuing safety integrity of a protective device or system. The Annex of the U.W.E. Directive gives general minimum requirements applicable to work equipment. If the equipment conforms to relevant product directives, e.g., The Machinery Directive, they will automatically comply with the corresponding machine design requirements given in the minimum requirements of the Annex.

There are many organizations that promote industrial safety in the United States. These include: 1. Corporations, which use established requirements as well as establish their own internal requirements; 2. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA);3. Industrial organizations like the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the Robotics Industries Association (RIA), and the Association of Manufacturing Technology (AMT), ANSI which publishes a list of recognized consensusstandards; and the suppliers of safety products and solutions such as RockwellAutomation. Occupational Safety and Health Administration In the United States, one of the main drivers of industrial safety is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA was established in 1971 by an Act of the U.S. Congress. The purpose of this act is to provide safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve human resources. The act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce. This Act shall apply with respect to employment performed in a workplace in a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Paciﬁ c Islands, Wake Island, Outer Continental Shelf Lands de ﬁ ned in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, Johnston Island, and the Canal Zone.

Article 5 also states that each employee shall comply with occupational safety and health standards and all rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to this Act which are applicable to his own actions and conduct. The OSHA Act places the responsibility on both the employer and the employee. This is quite divergent from Machinery Directive, which requires suppliers to place machines on the market that are free from hazards. In the U.S., a supplier can sell a machine without any safeguarding. The user must add the safeguarding to make the machine safe. Although this was a common practice when the Act was approved, the trend is for suppliers to provide machines with the safeguarding, as designing safety into a machine is far more cost effective than adding the safeguarding after the machine is designed and built. Standards are now attempting to get the supplier and user to communicate requirements for safeguarding so that machines are made not only safe but more productive. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to promulgate as an occupational safety or health standard any national consensus standard, and any established Federal standard, unless the promulgation of such a standard would not result in improved safety or health for speci ﬁ cally designated employees. OSHA accomplishes this task by publishing regulations in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulation (29 CFR). Standards pertaining to industrial machinery are published by OSHA in Part 1910 of 29 CFR. They are freely available on the OSHA website",

The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register. When a national consensus standard is incorporated by reference in one of the subparts, that standard has the ‘force of law’.For example, NFPA 70, a voluntary standard known as the US National Electric Code, is referenced in Subpart S. This makes the requirements in the NFPA70 standard mandatory. The 29 CFR 1910.147, in Subpart J, covers the control of hazardous energy. This is commonly known as the Lockout/Tagout standard. The equivalent voluntary standard is ANSI Z244.1. Essentially, this standard requires power to the machine to be locked out when undergoing service or maintenance. The purpose is to prevent the unexpected energization or startup of the machine which would result in injury to employees. Employers must establish a lockout and tagout program and utilize procedures for afﬁ xing appropriate lockout devices or tagout devices to energy isolating devices, and to otherwise disable machines or equipment to prevent unexpected energization, start up or release of stored energy in order to prevent injury to employees. Minor tool changes and adjustments, and other minor servicing activities, which take place during normal production operations, are covered by ANSI Z244 “Alternative Measures” if they are routine, repetitive, and integral to the use",

This is directly supported by OSHA in the “OSHA Minor Servicing Exception”. Alternative measures are safeguarding devices like light curtains, safety mats, gate interlocks and other similar devices connected to a safety system. The challenge to the machine designer and user is to determine what is “minor” and what is “routine, repetitive and integral.” This can be covered during the Risk Assessment. Subpart O covers “Machinery and Machine Guarding.” This subpart lists the general requirements for all machines as well as requirements for some speci ﬁ c machines. When OSHA was formed in 1971, it adopted many existing ANSI standards. For example B11.1 for mechanical power presses was adopted as 1910.217. The 1910.212 is the general OSHA standard for machines. It states that one or more methods of machine guarding shall be provided to protect the operator and other employees in the machine area from hazards such as those created by the point of operation, ingoing nip points, rotating parts, ﬂ ying chips and sparks.

Each province has its own regulations that are maintained and enforced. For example, Ontario established the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which sets out the rights and duties of all parties in the workplace. Its main purpose is to protect workers against health and safety hazards on the job. The Act establishes procedures for dealing with workplace hazards, and it provides for enforcement of the law where compliance has not been achieved voluntarily. Within the Act there is regulation 851, Section 7 that de ﬁ nes the Pre-Start Health and Safety review.

It is not intended to form an exhaustive list but rather to give an insight on what machinery safety issues are the subject of standardization. This section should be read in conjunction with the Regulation section. The countries of the world are working towards global harmonization of standards. This is especially evident in the area of machine safety. Global safety standards for machinery are governed by two organizations: ISO and IEC. Regional and country standards are still in existence and continue to support local requirements but in many countries there has been a move toward using the international standards produced by ISO and IEC. For example, the EN (European Norm) standards are used throughout the EEA countries. All new EN standards are aligned with, and in most cases have identical text with ISO and IEC standards. Also the US now often references IEC and ISO standards. IEC covers electrotechnical issues and ISO covers all other issues. Most industrialized countries are members of IEC and ISO. Machinery safety standards are written by working groups comprised of experts from many of the world’s industrialized counties. In most countries standards can be regarded as voluntary whereas regulations are legally mandatory. However standards are usually used as the practical interpretation of the regulations. Therefore the worlds of standards and regulations are closely interlinked. ISO (International Organization for Standardization)ISO is a non-governmental organization comprised of the national standards bodies of most of the countries of the world (157 countries at the time of this printing). A Central Secretariat, located in Geneva, Switzerland, coordinates the system. ISO generates standards for designing, manufacturing and using machinery more efﬁ ciently, safer and",

Their use is voluntary but designing and manufacturing equipment to them is the most direct way of demonstrating compliance with the EHSRs of the Machinery Directive. They are divided into 3 types: A, B and C standards. Type A. STANDARDS: Cover aspects applicable to all types of machines.Type B. STANDARDS: Subdivided into 2 groups. Type B1 STANDARDS: Cover particular safety and ergonomic aspects of machinery. Type B2 STANDARDS: Cover safety components and protective devices. Type C. STANDARDS: Cover speci ﬁ c types or groups of machines. It is important to note that complying with a C Standard gives automatic presumption of conformity with the EHSRs covered by that standard. In the absence of a suitable C Standard, A and B Standards can be used as part or full proof of EHSR conformity by pointing to compliance with relevant sections.

The mandatory provisions (e.g., the word shall implies mandatory) of the standards, incorporated by reference, have the same force and effects as the standards listed in Part 1910. For example, the national consensus standard NFPA 70 is listed as a reference document in Appendix A of Subpart S-Electrical of Part 1910 of 29 CFR. NFPA 70 is a voluntary standard, which was developed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). NFPA 70 is also known as the National Electric Code (NEC). By incorporation, all the mandatory requirements in the NEC are mandatory by OSHA. ANSI StandardsThe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) serves as the administrator and coordinator of the United States private sector voluntary standardization system. It is a private, non pro ﬁ t, membership organization supported by a diverse constituency of private and public sector organizations. ANSI, itself, does not develop standards; it facilitates the development of standards by establishing consensus among quali ﬁ ed groups. ANSI also ensures that the guiding principles of consensus, due process and openness are followed by the quali ﬁ ed groups. These standards are categorized as either application standards or construction standards. Application standards de ﬁ ne how to apply safeguarding to machinery.

    "text": "Fire Protection AssociationThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) was organized in 1896. Its mission is to reduce the burden of ﬁ re on the quality of life by advocating scienti ﬁ cally based consensus codes and standards, research and education for ﬁ re and related safety issues. The NFPA sponsors many standards to help accomplish its mission. Two very important standards related to industrial safety and safe-guarding are the National Electric Code (NEC) and Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery. The National Fire Protection Association has acted as sponsor of the NEC since 1911. The original code document was developed in 1897 as a result of the united efforts of various insurance, electrical, architectural, and allied interests. The NEC has since been updated numerous times; it is revised about every three years. 21MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Standards Article 670 of the NEC covers some details on industrial machinery and refers the reader to the Electrical Standard for Industrial Machinery, NFPA 79. NFPA 79 applies to electrical/electronic equipment, apparatus, or systems of industrial machines. The purpose of NFPA 79 is to provide detailed information for the application of electrical/electronic equipment, apparatus, or systems supplied as part of industrial machines that will promote safety to life and property. NFPA 79, which was of ﬁ cially adopted by ANSI in 1962, is very similar in content to the standard IEC 60204-1. Machines, which are not covered by speci ﬁ c OSHA standards, are required to be free of recognized hazards which may cause death or serious injuries. These machines must be designed and maintained to meet or exceed the requirements of applicable industry standards. NFPA 79 is a standard that would apply to machines not speciﬁ cally covered by OSHA standards. Canadian Standards CSA Standards re ﬂ ect a national consensus of producers and",

Not only will this ensure a more thorough job, but it will also make the results available for checking by other parties. This section applies both to machine manufacturers and to machine users. The manufacturer needs to ensure that his machine is capable of being used safely. The risk assessment should be started at the machine design phase and it should take account of all the foreseeable tasks that will need to be performed on the machine. This task based approach at the early iterations of the risk assessment is very important. For example, there may be a regular need for adjustment of moving parts at the machine. At the design phase it should be possible to design in measures that will allow this process to be carried out safely. If it is missed at the early stage it may be difﬁ cult or impossible to implement at later stage. The result could be",

A machine on which all tasks have been taken account of during the risk assessment will be a safer machine and a more efﬁ cient machine. The user (or employer) needs to ensure that the machines in their working environment are safe. Even if a machine has been declared safe by the manufacturer, the machine user should still perform a risk assessment to determine whether the equipment is safe in their environment. Machines are often used in circumstances unforeseen by the manufacturer. For example, a milling machine used in a school workshop will need additional considerations to one that is used in an industrial tool room. It is also possible that individual safe machines may be combined together in a manner that could be unsafe. It should also be remembered that if a user company acquires two or more independent machines and integrates them into one process they are the manufacturer of the resulting combined machine. So now let us consider the essential steps on the route to a proper safety strategy. The following can be applied to an existing factory installation or a single new machine.

Whichever technique is used to carry out a risk assessment, a cross functional team of people will usually produce a result with wider coverage and better balance than one individual. Risk assessment is an iterative process; it will be performed at different stages of the machine life cycle. The information available will vary according to the stage of the life cycle. For example, a risk assessment conducted by a machine builder will have access to every detail of the machine mechanisms and construction materials but probably only an approximate assumption of the machine’s ultimate working environment. A risk assessment conducted by the machine user would not necessarily have access to the in-depth technical details but will have access to every detail of the machines working environment. Ideally the output of one iteration will be the input for the next iteration. Machine Limit DeterminationThis involves collecting and analysing information regarding the parts, mechanisms and functions of a machine. It will also be necessary to consider all the types of human task interaction with the machine and the environment in which the machine will operate. The objective is to get a clear understanding of the machine and its usage. Where separate machines are linked together, either mechanically or by control systems, they should be considered as a single machine, unless they are “zoned” by appropriate protective measures. It is important to consider all limits and stages of the life of a machine including installation, commissioning, maintenance, decommissioning, correct use and operation as well as the consequences of reasonably foreseeable misuse or malfunction. 25MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Safety Strategy Task and Hazard Identiﬁ cation All the hazards at the machine must be identi ﬁ ed and listed in terms of their nature",

Types of hazard include crushing, shearing, entanglement, part ejection, fumes, radiation, toxic substances, heat, noise, etc. The results of the task analysis should be compared with the results of the hazard identi ﬁ cation. This will show where there is a possibility for the convergence of a hazard and a person i.e. a hazardous situation. All the hazardous situations should be listed. It may be possible that the same hazard could produce different types of hazardous situations depending on the nature of the person or the task. For example, the presence of a highly skilled and trained maintenance technician may have different implications than the presence of an unskilled cleaner who has no knowledge of the machine. In this situation if each case is listed and addressed separately it may be possible to justify different protective measures for the maintenance technician than the ones for the cleaner. If the cases are not listed and addressed separately then the worst case should be used and the maintenance and the cleaner will both be covered by the same protective measure. Sometimes it will be necessary to carry out a general risk assessment on an existing machine that already has protective measures ﬁ tted (e.g., a machine with dangerous moving parts protected by an interlocked guard door). The dangerous moving parts are a potential hazard that may become an actual hazard in the event of failure of the interlocking system. Unless that interlock system has already been validated (e.g., by risk assessment or design to an appropriate standard), its presence should not be taken into account.

At one hazard the risk could be so small that we can tolerate and accept it but at another hazard the risk could be so large that we need to go to extreme measures to protect against it. Therefore in order to make a decision on “if and what to do about the risk,” we need to be able to quantify it. Risk is often thought of solely in terms of the severity of injury at an accident. Both the severity of potential harm AND the probability of its occurrence have to be taken into account in order to estimate the amount of risk present.

The following text outlines the basic risk quanti ﬁ cation principles and is intended to provide help regardless of which methodology is used.

Decisions need to take account of what is feasible, realistic and plausible. This is where a cross functional team approach is valuable. At this stage you should usually not take account of any existing protective system. If this risk estimation shows that a protective system is required there are some methodologies as shown later in this chapter that can be used to determine the characteristics required. Severity of potential injuryFor this consideration we are presuming that the accident or incident has occurred. Careful study of the hazard will reveal what is the most severe injury possible. Remember: For this consideration we are presuming that an injury is inevitable and we are only concerned with its severity. You should assume that the operator is exposed to the hazardous motion or process.

Risk Reduction Now we must consider each machine and its respective risks in turn and take measures to address all of its hazards. Hierarchy of Measures for Risk Reduction There are three basic methods to be considered and used in the following order: 1. Eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible (inherently safe machinery design and construction). 2. Install safeguarding and complementary protective measures in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated by design. 3. Provision of information for safe use including warning signs and signals. Also information of any residual risks and whether any particular training or personal protection equipment is required.

Elimination of risk (inherently safe design)At the machine design phase it will be possible to avoid many of the possible hazards simply by careful consideration of factors such as materials, access requirements, hot surfaces, transmission methods, trap points, voltage levels etc. For example, if access is not required to a dangerous area, the solution is to safeguard it within the body of the machine or by some type of ﬁ xed enclosing guard. Protective measures and systems If access is required, then life becomes a little more dif ﬁ cult. It will be necessary to ensure that access can only be gained while the machine is safe. Protective measures such as interlocked guard doors and/or trip systems will be required. The choice of protective device or system should be heavily in ﬂ uenced by the operating characteristics of the machine. This is extremely important as a system that impairs machine ef ﬁ ciency will render itself liable to unauthorised removal or bypassing. 29MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Safety Strategy One of the most involved and complete interactions between people and machinery is during maintenance, troubleshooting and repair. For routine and minor interventions it may be possible to use safety related system based protective measures (see later description) to ensure safety. But across all regulations it is absolutely clear that, for any type of intervention such as signi ﬁ cant maintenance, repair, disassembly or work on power circuits, there should the both the provision and use of equipment that ensures the isolation and dissipation of energy (sometimes including gravitational force) at the machine. In this way the risk of unexpected start-up and exposure to energy sources can be eliminated. This is covered in many different regulations and standards. For example, see",

In terms of electrical technology IEC/EN 60204-1 and NFPA 79 also give guidance and requirements.Of course it is imperative that a proper working system that ensures all the correct procedures are followed. The following section describes some typical implementations. Prevention of unexpected power-up Prevention of unexpected power-up is covered by many standards. Examples include ISO14118, EN1037, ISO12100, OSHA 1910.147, ANSI Z244-1, CSA Z460-05, and AS 4024.1603. These standards have a common theme: the primary method of preventing unexpected power up is to remove the energy from the system and to lock the system in the off state. The purpose is to allow people to safely enter a machine’s hazard zones. Lockout / TagoutNew machines must be built with lockable energy isolating devices. The devices apply to all types of energy, including electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, gravity, and lasers. Lockout refers to applying a lock to an energy isolating device. The lock must only be removed by its owner or by a supervisor under controlled conditions. When multiple individuals must work on the machine, each individual must apply their locks to the energy isolating devices. Each lock must be identi ﬁ able to its owner. In the U.S., tagout is an alternative to lockout for older machines where a lockable device has never been installed. In this case, the machine is turned off and a tag is applied to warn all personnel to not start the machine while the tag holder is working on the machine. Beginning in 1990, machines that are modi ﬁ ed must be upgraded to include a lockable energy isolating device. MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control",

These devices can take the form of a circuit breaker, a disconnect switch, a manually operated switch, a plug/socket combination or a manually operated valve. Electrical isolating devices must switch all ungrounded supply conductors and no pole can operate independently. The purpose of lockout and tagout is to prevent the unexpected startup of the machine. Unexpected startup may be the result of various causes: a failure of the control system; an inappropriate action on a start control, sensor, contactor, or valve; a restoration of power after an interruption; or some other internal or external inﬂ uences. After completion of the lockout or tagout process, the dissipation of the energy must be veri ﬁ ed. Safety Isolation SystemsSafety isolation systems execute an orderly shutdown of a machine and also provide an easy method of locking off the power to a machine. This approach works well for larger machines and manufacturing systems, especially when multiple energy sources are located on a mezzanine level or at distant locations. Load DisconnectsFor local isolation of electrical devices, switches can be placed just prior to the device that needs to be isolated and locked out. The Bulletin 194E Load Switches are an example of a product that are capable of both isolation and lockout. Trapped Key SystemsTrapped key systems are another method for implementing a lockout system. Many trapped key systems start with an energy isolating device. When the switch is turned off by the “primary” key, the electrical energy to the machine is removed from all the ungrounded supply conductors simultaneously. The primary key can then be removed and taken to a location where machine access is needed. Various components can be added to accommodate",

Machine interventions during normal production operations are covered by safeguarding measures such as guard door interlocking systems. The difference between servicing/maintenance and normal production operations is not always clear. 31MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Safety Strategy Some minor adjustments and servicing tasks, which take place during normal production operations, do not necessarily require the machine to be locked out. Examples include loading and unloading materials, minor tool changes and adjustments, servicing lubrication levels, and removing waste material. These tasks must be routine, repetitive, and integral to the use of the equipment for production, and the work is performed using alternative measures, like safeguarding, which provide effective protection. Safeguarding includes devices like interlocked guards, light curtains, and safety mats. Used with appropriate safety rated logic and output devices, operators can safety access the machine danger zones during normal production tasks and minor interventions. The safety of the machine in this case will depend on the proper application and correct operation of the protective system even under fault conditions. The correct operation of the system must now be considered. Within each type there is likely to be a choice of technologies with varying degrees of performance of fault monitoring, detection or prevention. In an ideal world every protective system would be perfect with absolutely no possibility of failing to a dangerous condition. In the real world, however, we are constrained by the current limits of knowledge and materials. Another very real constraint is cost.

IEC/EN 62061 and (EN) ISO 13849-1 classify hierarchical levels of performance for safety related parts of control systems and they provide risk assessment methods in their annexes to determine the integrity requirements for a protective system.

EvaluationAfter the protective measure has been chosen and before it is implemented it is important to repeat the risk estimation. This is a procedure that is often missed. It may be that if we install a protective measure, the machine operator may feel that they are totally and completely protected against the original envisaged risk.Because they no longer have the original awareness of danger, they may intervene with the machine in a different way. They may be exposed to the hazard more often, or they may enter further into the machine for example. This means that if the protective measure fails they will be at a greater risk than envisaged before. This is the actual risk that we need to estimate. Therefore the risk estimation needs to be repeated taking into account any foreseeable changes in the way that people may intervene with the machine. The result of this activity is used to check whether the proposed protective measures are, in fact, suitable. For further information Annex A of IEC/EN 62061 is recommended.

It may also be necessary for the operator to use equipment such as special gloves, goggles, respirators, etc. The machinery designer should specify what sort of equipment is required. The use of personal protective equipment will not usually form the primary safeguarding method but will complement the measures shown above. There will also usually be a need for signs and marking to facilitate awareness of any residual risk. MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 34Chapter 4: Implementation of protective measures When the risk assessment shows that a machine or process carries a risk of injury, the hazard must be eliminated or contained. The manner in which this is achieved will depend on the nature of the machine and the hazard. Safety control system protective measures in conjunction with guarding either prevent access to a hazard or prevent dangerous motion at a hazard when access is available. Typical examples of safety control system protective measures are discussed later and include interlocked guards, light curtains, safety mats, two-hand controls and enabling switches. Emergency stop devices and systems are associated with safety related control systems but they are not direct protective systems, they should only be regarded as complementary protective measures. Preventing Access with Fixed Enclosing GuardsIf the hazard is on a part of the machinery which does not require access, a guard should be permanently ﬁ xed to the machinery. These types of guards must require tools for removal. The ﬁ xed guards must be able to 1) withstand their operating environment, 2) contain projectiles where necessary, and 3) not create hazards by having, for example, sharp edges. Fixed guards",

Detecting AccessProtective measures can be used to detect access to a hazard. When detection is selected as the method of risk reduction, the designer must understand that a complete safety system must be used; the safeguarding device, by itself, does not provide necessary risk reduction. This safety system generally consists of three blocks: 1) an input device that senses the access to the hazard, 2) a logic device that process the signals from the sensing device, checks the status of the safety system and turns on or off output devices, and 3) an output device that controls the actuator (for example, a motor). 35MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures Detection Devices Many alternative devices are available to detect the presence of a person entering or inside a hazard area. The best choice for a particular application is dependent on a number of factors. • Environmental factors that might impact the detector reliability • Frequency of access,• Stopping time of hazard,• Importance of completing the machine cycle, and• Containment of projectiles, ﬂ uids, mists, vapours, etc. Appropriately selected movable guards can be interlocked to provide protection against projectiles,",

Presence sensing devices, like light curtains, mats and laser scanners, provide quick and easy access to the hazard area and are often selected when operators must frequently access the hazard area. These types of devices do not provide protection against projectiles, mists, ﬂ uids, or other types of hazards. The best choice of protective measure is a device or system that provides the maximum protection with the minimum hindrance to normal machine operation.

Presence Sensing Devices IEC 62046 gives useful guidance on the application of presence sensing devices. Its use is recommended. When deciding how to protect a zone or area it is important to have a clear understanding of exactly what safety functions are required. In general there will be at least two functions.• Switch off or disable power when a person enters the hazard area.• Prevent switching on or enabling of power when a person is in the hazard area. At ﬁ rst thought these may seem to be one and the same thing but although they are obviously linked, and are often achieved by the same equipment, they are actually two separate safety functions.

The location of the object is determined by the angle of rotation of the mirror. Using a “time-of- ﬂ ight” technique of a re ﬂ ected beam of invisible light, the scanner can also detect the distance the object is from the 37MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures scanner. By taking the measured distance and the location of the object, the laser scanner determines the exact position of the object. Pressure Sensitive Safety MatsThese devices are used to provide guarding of a ﬂ oor area around a machine. A matrix of interconnected mats is laid around the hazard area and pressure applied to the mat (e.g., an operator’s footstep) will cause the mat controller unit to switch off power to the hazard. Pressure sensitive mats are often used within an enclosed area containing several machines, ﬂ exible manufacturing systems or robotics cells. When cell access is required (for setting or robot “teaching,” for example), they prevent dangerous motion if the operator strays from the safe area. It is important to prevent any movement of the mat(s) by correct and secure ﬁ xing. Pressure Sensitive Edges These devices are ﬂ exible edging strips that can be mounted to the edge of a moving part, such as a machine table or powered door that poses a risk of a crushing or shearing. If the moving part strikes the operator (or vice versa), the ﬂ exible sensitive edge is depressed and will initiate a command to switch off the hazard power source.

Light curtains, scanners, ﬂ oor mats and sensitive edges are also classi ﬁ ed as “trip devices.” They do not actually restrict access but only “sense” it. They rely entirely on their ability to both sense and switch for the provision of safety. In general they are only suitable on machinery which stops reasonably quickly after switching off the power source. Because an operator can walk or reach directly into the hazard area it is obviously necessary that the time taken for the motion to stop is less than that required for the operator to reach the hazard after tripping the device. Safety SwitchesWhen access to the machine is infrequent or when there is a possibility of part ejection, movable (operable) guards are often preferred. The guard is interlocked with the power source of the hazard in a manner which ensures that whenever the guard door is not closed the hazard power will be switched off. This approach involves the use of an interlocking switch ﬁ tted to the guard door. The control of the power source of the hazard is routed through the switch section of the unit. The power source is usually electrical but it could also be pneumatic or hydraulic. When guard door movement (opening) is detected the interlocking switch MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 38will initiate a command to isolate the hazard power supply either directly or via a power contactor (or valve).

There is a wide variety of safety switch options including:•Tongue Interlock Switches - these devices require a tongue-shaped actuator to be inserted and removed from the switch for operation •Hinge Interlock Switches - these devices are placed on the hinge-pin of a guard door and utilize the opening action of the guard to actuate. •Guardlocking Switches - In some applications, locking the guard closed or delaying the opening of the guard is required. Devices suitable for this requirement are called guardlocking interlock switches. They are suited tomachines with run down characteristics but they can also provide a signi ﬁ cant increase of protection level for most types of machines. •Non-contact Interlock Switches - these devices require no physical contactto actuate with some versions incorporating a coding function for increasedresistance to tampering. •Position (Limit Switch) Interlocks - Cam operated actuation usually takes the form of a positive mode limit (or position) switch and a linear or rotary cam. It isgenerally used on sliding guards. •Trapped Key Interlocks - Trapped keys can perform control interlocking as wellas power interlocking. With “control interlocking,” an interlock device initiates astop command to an intermediate device, which turns off a subsequent deviceto disconnect the energy from the actuator.

This is considered an uncontrolled stop. With power removed, braking action requiring power will not be effective. This will allow motors to free spin and coast to a stop over an extended period of time. In other cases, material may be dropped by machine holding ﬁ xtures, which require power to hold the material. Mechanical stopping means (brakes), not requiring power, may also be a used with a category 0 stop. The category 0 stop takes priority over category 1 or category 2 stops. Category 1 is a controlled stop with power available to the machine actuators to achieve the stop. Power is then removed from the actuators when the stop is achieved. This category of stop allows powered braking to quickly stop hazardous motion, and then power can be removed from the actuators. This type of stop may result in a faster and more controlled stop from which a restart can be quicker. NOTE: The 2016 Edition of IEC/EN 60204-1 will expand the types of Category 1 stop. Category 2 is a controlled stop with power left available to the machine actuators. A normal production stop is considered a category 2 stop. These stop categories must be applied to each stop function, where the stop function is the action taken by the safety related parts of the control system in response to an input, category 0 or 1 should be used.

The emergency stop device must be continuously operable and readily available. Operator panels should contain at least one emergency stop device. Additional emergency stop devices may be used at other locations as needed. Emergency Stop devices come in various forms.

An additional contact is added to the back estop that monitors whether the back of the panel components are still present. This is known as a self-monitoring contact block. It consists of a spring actuated contact that closes when the contact block is snapped into place onto the panel. Cable Pull SwitchesFor machinery such as conveyors, it is often more convenient and effective to use a cable pull device along the hazard area as the emergency stop device. These devices use a steel wire rope connected to latching pull switches so that pulling on the rope in any direction at any point along its length will trip the switch and cut off the machine power. The cable pull switches must detect both a pull on the cable as well as when the cable goes slack. Slack detection monitors that the cable has not been cut and is ready for use. Cable distance affects performance of the switch. For short distances, the safety switch is mounted on one end and a tension spring mounted at the other. For longer distances, a safety switch must be mounted at both ends of the cable to ensure that a single action by the operator initiates a stop command.

Enabling devices use either two-position or three position types of switches. Two position types are off when the actuator is not operated, and are on when the actuator is operated. Three position switches are off when not actuated (position 1), on when held in the centre position (position 2) and off when the actuator is operated past the mid position (position 3).

Modular and conﬁ gurable monitoring safety relays are preferred where a large and diverse number of safeguarding devices and minimal zone control are required. The medium to large and more complex machine may ﬁ nd programmable safety systems with distributed I/O to be preferable. Monitoring Safety Relays (MSR)Monitoring safety relay (MSR) modules play a key role in many safety systems. These modules are usually comprised of two or more positively guided relays with additional circuitry to ensure the performance of the safety function. 43MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures Positive guided relays are designed to prevent the normally closed and normally open contacts from being closed simultaneously. Some monitoring safety relays have safety rated solid state outputs. Monitoring safety relays perform many checks on the safety system. Upon power- up, they perform self-checks on their internal components. When the input devices are activated, the MSR compares the results of redundant inputs. If acceptable, the MSR checks external actuators connected to its outputs. If okay, the MSR awaits a reset signal to energize its outputs. Therefore a correctly selected and con ﬁ gured MSR can provide system fault detection by checking its connected input and output devices. It can also provide a start/restart interlock. The selection of the appropriate safety relay is dependent on a number of factors: the type of device it monitors, the type of reset, the number and type of outputs etc. Types of Inputs to Monitoring Safety Relays (MSR)Different types of safeguarding devices provide different types of inputs to a monitoring safety relay so it is important to check for compatibility.

The designer must select or con ﬁ gure an MSR that is compatible with the input device. Input ImpedanceThe input impedance of the monitoring safety relays determines how many input devices can be connected to the relay and how far away the input devices can be mounted. For example, a safety relay may have a maximum allowable input impedance of 500 ohms. When the input impedance is greater than 500 ohms, it will not switch on its outputs. Care must be taken by the user to ensure that the input impedance remains below the maximum speci ﬁ cation. The length, size and type of wire used affects input impedance. Number of Input DevicesThe risk assessment process should be used to help determine how many input devices should be connected to a monitoring safety relay unit MSR and how often the input devices should be checked. To assure that emergency stops and gate interlocks are in an operational state, they should be checked for operation at regular intervals, as determined by the risk assessment. For example, a dual channel input MSR connected to an interlocked gate that must be opened every machine cycle (e.g., several times per day) may not have to be checked. This is because opening the guard causes the MSR to check itself, its inputs and its outputs (depending on con ﬁ guration) for single faults. The more frequent the guard opening the greater the integrity of the checking process. Another example might be emergency stops. Since emergency stops are typically used only for emergencies, they are likely to be rarely used. Therefore a program should be established to exercise the emergency stops and con ﬁ rm their effectiveness on",

A third example might be access doors for machine 45MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures adjustments, which like emergency stops might be rarely used. Here again a program should be established to exercise the checking function on a scheduled basis. The risk assessment will help determine whether the input devices need to be checked and how often they should be checked. The higher the level of risk, the greater integrity required of the checking process. And the less frequent the “automatic” checking, the more frequent should be the imposed “manual” check. Input Cross-fault DetectionIn dual channel systems, channel-to-channel short circuit faults of the input devices, also known as cross-faults, must be detected by the safety system. This is accomplished by the sensing device or the monitoring safety relay. Microprocessor based monitoring safety relays, like light curtains, laser scanners and advanced non-contact sensors detect these shorts in a variety of ways. One common way of detecting cross-faults is by using pulse testing. The signals input to the MSR are pulsed very quickly. The channel 1 pulse is offset from the channel 2 pulse. If a short occurs, the pulses occur concurrently and are detected by the device. Electro-mechanical based monitoring safety relays employ a different diversity technique: one pull-up input and one pull-down input. A short from Channel 1 to Channel 2 will make the overcurrent protection device active and the safety system will shut down. OutputsMSRs come with various numbers of outputs. The types of outputs help determine which MSR must be used in speci ﬁ c applications. Most MSRs have at least 2 immediately operating safety outputs. MSR safety outputs are characterized as normally-open. These are safety rated due to the",

Delayed-off outputs are typically used in Category 1 stops, where the machine requires time to execute the stopping function before allowing access to the hazard area.

Typically, the ratings for industrial devices are described as resistive or electromagnetic. A resistive load may be a heater type element.

The Allen-Bradley Guardmaster products are typically rated at 125VAC, 250VAC and 24VDC. VA: The VA (Voltage x Amperage) ratings indicate the ratings of the switching elements when making the circuit as well as breaking the circuit. Example 1: An A150, AC-15 rating indicates that the contacts can make a 7200VA circuit. At 120V AC, the contacts can make a 60 amp inrush circuit. Since the AC-15 is an electromagnetic load, the 60 amp is only for a short duration; the inrush current of the electromagnetic load. The breaking of the circuit is only 720 VA because the steady state current of the electromagnetic load is 6A, which is the rated operational current. Example 2: An N150, DC-13 rating indicates that the contacts can make a 275VA circuit. At 125V AC, the contacts can make a 2.2 amp circuit. DC electromagnetic 47MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures loads do not have an inrush current like AC electromagnetic loads.

Machine Re-startIf, for example, an interlocked guard is opened on an operating machine, the safety interlock switch will stop that machine. In most circumstances it is imperative that the machine does not restart immediately when the guard is closed. A common way of achieving this is to rely on a latching contactor start arrangement. Pressing and releasing the start button momentarily energizes the contactor control coil which closes the power contacts. As long as power is ﬂ owing through the power contacts the control coil is kept energized (electrically latched) via the contactor’s auxiliary",

Any interruption to the main power or control supply results in the de-energizing of the coil and opening of the main power and auxiliary contacts. The guard interlock is wired into the contactor control circuit. This means that restart can only be achieved by closing the guard and then switching “ON” at the normal start button which resets the contactor and starts the machine. The requirement for normal interlocking situations is made clear in ISO 12100 (extract): “When the guard is closed, the hazardous machine functions covered by the guard can operate, but the closure of the guard does not by itself initiate their operation”. Many machines already have either single or double contactors which operate as described above (or have a system which achieves the same result). When ﬁ tting an interlock to existing machinery it is necessary to determine whether the power control arrangement meets this requirement and take additional measures if necessary. Reset FunctionsAllen Bradley Guardmaster monitoring safety relays are designed with either monitored manual reset or automatic/manual reset. Monitored Manual ResetA monitored manual reset requires a change of state of the reset circuit after the gate is closed or the emergency stop is reset. The mechanically linked normally closed auxiliary contacts of the power switching contactors are connected in series with a momentary push button. After the guard has been opened and closed again, the safety relay will not allow the machine to be restarted until there is a change of MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 48state at the reset button.

If these checks are successful the machine can then be restarted from the normal controls. (EN) ISO 13849-1 cites the change of state from energized to de-energized (‘falling edge’). The reset switch should be located in a place that provides a good view of the hazard so that the operator can check that the area is clear before operation. Auto/ Manual ResetSome safety relays have automatic/manual reset. The manual reset mode is not monitored and reset occurs when the button is pressed. A short circuited or jammed in reset switch will not be detected. With this approach it may not be possible to achieve the requirements for additional manual reset as given in (EN) ISO 13849-1 unless additional means are used. Alternatively the reset line can be jumpered allowing an automatic reset. The user must then provide another mechanism for preventing machine start-up when the gate closes. An auto-reset device does not require a manual switching action but after de- actuation it will always conduct a system integrity check before resetting the system. An auto-reset system should not be confused with a device without reset facilities. In the latter the safety system will be enabled immediately after de-actuation but there will be no system integrity check.

SoftwareSafety PLCs program very much like standard PLCs do. All of the additional diagnostics and error checking mentioned earlier is done by the operating system, so the programmer is not even aware that it is happening. Most safety PLCs will have special instructions used to write the program for the safety system, and these instructions tend to mimic the function of their safety relay counterparts. For example, the Emergency Stop instruction operates very much like an MSR. Though the logic behind each of these instructions is complex, the safety programs look relatively simple because the programmer simply connects these blocks together. These instructions, along with other logical, math, data manipulation, etc. instructions are certi ﬁ ed by a third party to ensure their operation is consistent with the applicable standards.

Safety networks are designed to detect transmission errors and initiate an appropriate fault reaction function. Communication errors that are detected include: message insertion, message loss, message corruption, message delay, message repeat, and incorrect message sequence. For most applications, when an error is detected the device will go to a known de- energized state, typically called a “safe state.” The safety input or output communication module is responsible for detecting these communication errors and then going to the safe state if appropriate. Early safety networks were tied to a particular media type or media access scheme, so manufacturers were required to use speci ﬁ c cables, network interface cards, routers, bridges, etc. that also became part of the safety function. These networks were limited in that they only supported communication between safety devices.This meant that manufacturers were required to use two or more networks for their machine control strategy (one network for standard control and another for safety related control) increasing installation, training and spare parts costs. Modern safety networks allow a single network cable to communicate with safety and standard control devices. CIP (Common Industrial Protocol) Safety is an open standard protocol published by ODVA (Open DeviceNet Vendors Association) that allows for safety communications between safety devices on DeviceNet, ControlNet and EtherNet/IP networks. Because CIP Safety is an extension to the standard CIP protocol, safety devices and standard devices can all reside on the same network.

On safety rated devices, the armature is protected from manual override to mitigate unexpected startup. On safety control relays, the normally closed contact is driven by the main spanner.

Often, a surge suppressor is placed across the coil to improve the life of the contacts driving the coil. For AC powered coils, the drop out time is not affected. For DC powered coils, the drop out time is increased. The increase is dependent on the type of suppression selected. Control relays and contactors are designed to switch large loads, anywhere from 0.5A to over 100A. The safety system operates on low currents. The feedback signal generated by the safety system logic device can be on the order of a few milliamps to tens of milliamps, usually at 24VDC. The safety control relays and safety contactors use gold plated bifurcated contacts to reliably switch this small current. 55MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures Overload Protection Overload protection for motors is required by electrical standards. Diagnostics provided by the overload protection device enhances not only equipment safety but operator safety as well. Technologies available today can detect fault conditions like an overload, phase loss, ground fault, stall, jam, under-load, current imbalance and over-temperature. Detecting and communicating abnormal conditions prior to tripping help to improve production up time and help prevent operators and maintenance people from unforeseen hazardous conditions Drives and ServosSafety rated drives and servos can be used to prevent rotational energy from being delivered to achieve a safety stop as well as an emergency stop. AC drives achieve the safety rating with redundant channels to remove power to the gate control circuitry. The redundant channels are monitored by either external or integral logic depending on the type of drive. This redundant approach allows the safety rated drive to",

Connection SystemsConnection systems add value by reducing the installation and maintenance costs of safety systems. Designs must take into account consideration of single channel, dual channel, dual channel with indication and multiple types of devices. When a series connection of dual channel interlocks is needed, a distribution block can simplify installation. With an IP67 rating, these types of boxes can be mounted on the machine at remote locations. When a diverse set of devices is required, an ArmorBlock Guard I/O box can be used. The inputs can be con ﬁ gured by software to accommodate various types of devices. MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 56Chapter 5: Safety Distance Calculation Hazards must come to a safe state prior to an operator reaching the hazard. For the safety distance calculation, there are two groups of standards. In this chapter, these standards are grouped as follows: ISO EN: (EN ISO 13855)US CAN (ANSI B11.19, ANSI RIA R15.06 and CAN/CSA Z434-03)FormulaThe minimum safety distance is dependent on the time required to process the Stop command and how far the operator can penetrate the detection zone before detection. The formula used throughout the world has the same form and requirements. The differences are the symbols used to represent the variables and the units of measure. The formulas are:ISO EN: S = K x T + CUS CAN: Ds = K x (Ts + Tc + Tr + Tbm) + DpfWhere: Ds and S are the minimum safe distance from the danger zone to the closest detection point Directions of ApproachWhen considering the safety",

Three types of approaches are considered: Normal - an approach perpendicular to the detection planeHorizontal - an approach parallel to the detection planeAngled - an angled approach to the detection zone. 57MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Safety Distance Calculation Speed Constant K is a speed constant. The value of the speed constant is dependent on movements of the operator (i.e. hand speeds, walking speeds, and stride lengths). This parameter is based on research data showing that it is reasonable to assume a 1600mm/sec (63in/s) hand speed of an operator while the body is stationary. The circumstances of the actual application must be taken into account. As a general guideline, the approach speed will vary from 1600mm/s (63in/s) to 2500mm/sec (100in/s). The appropriate speed constant must be determined by the risk assessment. Stopping TimeT is the overall stopping time of the system. The total time, in seconds, starts from the initiation of the stop signal to the cessation of the hazard. This time can be broken down to its incremental parts (Ts, Tc, Tr and Tbm) for easier analysis. Ts is the worst case stopping time of the machine/equipment. Tc is the worst case stopping time of the control system. Tr is the response time of the safeguarding device, including its interface. Tbm is additional stopping time allowed by the brake monitor before it detects stop-time deterioration beyond the end users’ predetermined limits. Tbm is used with part revolution mechanical presses. Ts + Tc + Tr are usually measured by a stop-time measuring device if the values are unknown. Depth Penetration FactorsThe Depth Penetration Factors is represented by the symbols C and Dpf.

These mountings are not considered angled if they are within ±5° of the intended design. When the angle exceeds ±5°, the potential risks (e.g. shortest distance) of foreseeable approaches must be taken into consideration. In general, angles greater than 30° from the reference plane (e.g. ﬂ oor) should be considered normal and those less than 30 considered parallel. Safety Mats With safety mats, the safety distance must take into account the operators pace and stride. Assuming the operator is walking and the safety mats are mounted on the ﬂ oor. The operator’s ﬁ rst step onto the mat is a depth penetration factor of 1200mm or 48 in. If the operator must step up onto a platform, then the depth penetration factor can be reduced by a factor of 40% of the height of the step.

MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 60Chapter 6: Safety Related Control Systems Introduction What is a safety related control system (often abbreviated to SRCS)? It is that part of the control system of a machine that prevents a hazardous condition from occurring. It can be a separate dedicated system or it may be integrated with the normal machine control system. Its complexity will vary from a simple system, such as a guard door interlock switch and emergency stop switch connected in series to the control coil of power contactor, to a compound system comprising both simple and complex devices communicating through software and hardware. Safety related control systems are designed to perform safety functions. The SRCS must continue to operate correctly under all foreseeable conditions. So what is a safety function; how do we design a system to achieve this; and when we have done that, how do we show it? Safety FunctionA safety function is implemented by the safety-related parts of the machine control system to achieve or maintain the equipment under control in a safe state with respect to a speciﬁ c hazard or set of hazards. A failure of the safety function can result in an immediate increase of the risks of using the equipment; that is, a hazardous condition. A “hazardous condition” is when a person could be exposed to a hazard. A hazardous condition does not imply that the person is harmed. The exposed person may be able to acknowledge the hazard and avoid injury.",

    "text": "The exposed person may not be able to recognize the hazard, or the hazard may be initiated by unexpected startup. The main task of the safety system designer is to prevent hazardous conditions and to prevent unexpected startup. The safety function can often be described with multi-part requirements. For example, the safety function initiated by an interlocking guard has three parts: 1. The hazards protected by the guard cannot operate until the guard is closed;2. Opening the guard will cause the hazard to stop if operational at the time of the opening; and 3. The closure of the guard does not restart the hazard protected by the guard. 61MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Safety Related Control Systems & Functional Safety When stating the safety function for a speci ﬁ c application, the word “hazard” must be changed to the speci ﬁ c hazard. The source of the hazard must not be confused with the results of the hazard. Crushing, cutting, and burning are results of a hazard. An example of a hazard source is a motor, ram, knife, torch, pump, laser, robot, end-effector, solenoid, valve, other type of actuator, or a mechanical hazard involving gravity. In discussing safety systems, the phrase “at or before a demand is placed on the safety function” is used. What is a demand on the safety function? Examples of demands placed on the safety function are the opening of an interlocked guard, the breaking of a light curtain, the stepping onto a safety mat, or the pressing of an emergency stop. An operator is demanding that the hazard either stop or remain de-energized if it is already stopped. The safety-related parts of the machine control system execute the safety function. The safety function is not executed by a single device, for example, just by the guard.",

    "text": "The interlock on the guard sends a command to a logic device, which in turn, disables an actuator. The safety function starts with the command and ends with the implementation. The safety system must be designed with a level of integrity that is commensurate with the risks of the machine. Higher risks require higher integrity levels to ensure the performance of the safety function. Machine safety systems can be classi ﬁ ed into levels of performance of their ability to ensure the operation of their safety function or, in other words, their functional safety integrity level. Functional Safety of Control Systems What is Functional Safety? Functional safety is the part of the overall safety requirement and that depends on the correct functioning of the process or equipment in response to its inputs. IEC TR 61508-0 provides the following example to help clarify the meaning of functional safety. “For example, an over-temperature protection device, using a thermal sensor in the windings of an electric motor to de-energize the motor before they can overheat, is an instance of functional safety. But providing specialized insulation to withstand high temperatures is not an instance of functional safety (although it is still an instance of safety and could protect against exactly the same hazard).” As another example, compare hard guarding to an interlocked guard. The hard guarding is not considered “functional safety” although it may protect against access to the same hazard as an interlocked door. The interlocked door is an instance of functional safety. When the guard is opened, the interlock serves as an “input” to a system that achieves a safe state. Similarly, personal protective equipment (PPE) MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 62is used as a protective measure to help increase safety of personnel. PPE is not considered functional",

    "text": "safety. Functional safety was a term introduced in IEC 61508:1998. Since then, the term has sometimes been associated only with programmable safety systems. This is a misconception. Functional safety covers a broad range of devices that are used to create safety systems. Devices like interlocks, light curtains, safety relays, safety PLCs, safety contactors, and safety drives are interconnected to form a safety system, which performs a speci ﬁ c safety-related function. This is functional safety. Therefore the functional safety of an electrical control system is highly relevant to the control of hazards arising from moving parts of machinery. Two types of requirements are necessary to achieve functional safety:• The safety function and • The safety integrity. Risk assessment plays a key role in developing the functional safety requirements. Task and hazard analysis leads to the functional requirements for safety (i.e. the safety function). The risk quantiﬁ cation yields the safety integrity requirements (i.e. the safety integrity or performance level). Four of the most signiﬁ cant control system functional safety standards for machinery are:1. IEC/EN 61508 “Functional safety of safety related electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems”This standard contains the requirements and provisions that are applicable to the design of complex electronic and programmable systems and subsystems.The standard is generic so it is not restricted to the machinery sector. 2. IEC/EN 62061 “Safety of machinery - Functional safety of safety related electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems” This standard is the machinery speci ﬁ c implementation of IEC/EN 61508. It provides requirements that are applicable to the system level design of all types of machinery safety-related electrical control systems and also for the design ofnon-complex subsystems or devices.

In order to show that both standards give equivalent results the report shows an example safety system calculated according to the methodologies of both standards. The report also clari ﬁ es a number of issues that have been subject to different interpretations. Perhaps one of the most signi ﬁ cant issues is the aspect of fault exclusion. In general, where PLe is required for a safety function to be implemented by a safety-related control system it is not normal to rely upon fault exclusions alone to achieve this level of performance. This is dependent upon the technology used and the intended operating environment. Therefore it is essential that the designer takes additional care on the use of fault exclusions as the PL requirement increases. In general the use of fault exclusions is not applicable to the mechanical aspects of electromechanical position switches in order to achieve PLe in the design of a safety-related control system. Those fault exclusions that can be applied to speci ﬁ c mechanical fault conditions (e.g. wear/corrosion, fracture) are described in Table A.4 of ISO 13849-2. For example, a door interlocking system that has to achieve PLe will need to incorporate a minimum fault tolerance of 1 (e.g. two conventional mechanical position switches) in order to achieve this level of performance since it is not normally justi ﬁ able to exclude faults, such as broken switch actuators.

There are three SILs used in the machinery sector, SIL 1 is the lowest and SIL 3 is the highest. Because the term SIL is applied in the same manner in other industrial sectors such as petro-chemicals, power generation and railways, IEC/EN 62061 is very useful when machinery is used within those sectors. Risks of greater magnitude can occur in other sectors such as the process industry and for that reason IEC 61508 and the process sector speci ﬁ c standard IEC 61511 include SIL 4. 65MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Safety Related Control Systems & Functional Safety A SIL applies to a safety function. The subsystems that make up the system that implements the safety function must have an appropriate SIL capability. This is sometimes referred to as the SIL Claim Limit (SIL CL). A full and detailed study of IEC/EN 62061 is required before it can be correctly applied.

MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 66Chapter 7: System design according to (EN) ISO 13849 A full and detailed study of (EN) ISO 13849-1 is required before it can be correctly applied. The following is a brief overview: This standard provides requirements for the design and integration of safety-related parts of control systems, including some software aspects. The standard applies to a safety-related system but can also be applied to the component parts of the system. SISTEMA Software PL Calculation ToolSISTEMA is a software tool for the implementation of (EN) ISO 13849-1. Its use will greatly simplify the quanti ﬁ cation and calculation aspects of the implementation of the standard. SISTEMA stands for “Safety Integrity Software Tool for the Evaluation of Machine Applications” and is regularly reviewed and updated by IFA. It requires the input of various types of functional safety data as described later in this section. The data can be input manually or automatically by using a manufacturer’s SISTEMA Data Library. The Rockwell Automation SISTEMA Data Library is available for download, together with a link to the SISTEMA download site, at: www.rockwellautomation.com, under Solutions & Services > Safety Solutions. Overview of (EN) ISO 13849-1The following general overview is intended to provide an overview of the basic provisions of (EN) ISO 13849-1. It also includes some mention of its revision published early in 2106. It is essential that the standard itself is studied in full detail.This standard has wide applicability, as it applies to all technologies, including electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic and mechanical.

The outputs of ISO 13849-1 are Performance Levels [PL a, b, c, d or e]. The original Category concept is retained but there are additional requirements to be satis ﬁ ed before a PL can be claimed for a system. The requirements can be listed in basic form as follows:• The architecture of the system. Essentially this captures what we have become used to as Categories 67MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 System Design According to (EN) ISO 13849 • Reliability data is required for the constituent parts of the system • The Diagnostic Coverage [DC] of the system is required. This represents the effectiveness of fault monitoring in the system • Protection against common cause failure• Protection against systematic faults• Where relevant, speci ﬁ c requirements for software Later we will take a closer look at these factors but before we do, it will be useful to consider the basic intent and principle of the whole standard. It is clear at this stage that there are additional considerations to learn but the detail will make more sense once we have understood what the standard is trying to achieve and why. First of all why do we need the standard? It is obvious that the technology used in machine safety systems has progressed and changed considerably over the last ten years. Until relatively recently safety systems have depended on “simple” equipment with very foreseeable and predictable failure modes. Now we have an increasing use of more complex electronic and programmable electronic devices in safety systems. This has given us advantages in terms of cost, ﬂ exibility and compatibility but it has also meant that the pre-existing standards are no longer adequate. In",

As safety systems are using a more “black box” approach by integrating pre-quali ﬁ ed subsystems we rely more heavily on their conformity to standards. Therefore those standards need to be capable of properly interrogating the technology. In order to ful ﬁ l this they must speak to the basic factors of reliability, fault detection, architectural and systematic integrity. This is the intent of (EN) ISO 13849-1. In order to plot a logical course through the standard, two fundamentally different user types must be considered: the designer of safety-related subsystems and the designers of safety-related systems. In general the subsystem designer [typically a safety component manufacturer] will be subjected to a higher level of rigor. They will need to provide the required data in order that the system designer can ensure that the subsystem is of adequate integrity for the system. This will usually require some testing, analysis and calculation. The results will be expressed in the form of the data required by the standard. The system designer [typically a machine designer or integrator] will use the subsystem data to perform some relatively straightforward calculations as part of the determination of the overall performance level [PL] achieved by the system.

This also often applies to the machine builder who produces the machine but does not necessarily know the exact conditions under which it will be used. The standard does provide some help by listing out many of the commonly used safety functions (e.g. safety-related stop function initiated by safeguard, muting function, start/restart function) and providing some normally associated requirements. Study of (EN) ISO 12100: ”Basic design principles and Risk assessment” is recommended for use at this stage. ISO TR 22100-2 provides useful guidance on the relationship between the machine risk assessment process from ISO 12100 and the PL allocation process of (EN) ISO 13849-1. There is a large range of machine speci ﬁ c standards that will provide safety function requirements for speci ﬁ c machines. Within the European EN standards they are termed C type standards, some of them have exact equivalents in ISO standards. ISO TR 22100-1 provides further information on the relationship between ISO 12100 and C standards. It is clear that the safety concept design stage is dependent on the type of machine and also on the characteristics of the application and environment in which it is used. The machine builder must anticipate these factors in order to be able to design the safety concept. The intended [i.e. anticipated] conditions of use should be given in the user manual. The user of the machine needs to check that they match the actual usage conditions. The PLr is used to denote what performance level is required by the safety function and this is determined during the Risk Assessment.

We need to view our system in the same way as the standard so let’s start with that. System StructureAny system can be split into basic system components or “subsystems.” Each subsystem has its own discrete function. Most systems can be split into three basic functions; input, logic solving and actuation [some simple systems may not have logic solving]. Input SubsystemLogic SubsystemOutput Subsystem The component groups that implement these functions are the subsystems.

Input Subsystem 440C-CR30 Safety ContactorLogic SubsystemOutput Subsystem Limit Switch Dual channel safety system A dual channel [also called redundant or “fault-tolerant”] system shown above. Each subsystem has two channels and can tolerate a single fault and still provide the safety function. This safety function would need to have two failures, one in each channel before the subsystem, and therefore the system, fails. Clearly a dual channel system is less likely to fail to a dangerous condition than a single channel system. But we can make it even more reliable [in terms of its safety function] if we include diagnostic measures for fault detection. Of course, having detected the fault we also need to react to it and put the system into a safe state. The following diagram shows the inclusion of diagnostic measures achieved by monitoring techniques.

Therefore we can see that, in this case each subsystem has two “sub channels”. The standard describes these as “blocks”. A two channel subsystem will have a minimum of two blocks and a single channel subsystem will have a minimum of one block. It is possible that some systems will comprise a combination of dual channel and single channel blocks.

The output contactor subsystem is subdivided down to its block level. The logic subsystem is not subdivided because it is already quali ﬁ ed and validated by the manufacturer to a given PL. The monitoring function for both the limit switches and the contactors is performed by the logic controller. Therefore the boxes representing the limit switch and contactor subsystems have a small overlap with the logic subsystem box. This principle of system subdivision can be recognised in the methodology given in (EN) ISO 13849-1 and in the basic system structure principle for the SISTEMA tool. However it is important to note that there are some subtle differences. The standard is not restrictive in its methodology, but for the simpli ﬁ ed method for estimating the PL the usual ﬁ rst step is to break the complete system into channels and then into the blocks within each channel. With SISTEMA it is usually more convenient to divide the system into subsystems and then each subsystem into blocks. The standard does not explicitly describe a subsystem concept but its use as given in SISTEMA provides a more understandable and intuitive approach. Of course there is no effect on the ﬁ nal calculation. SISTEMA and the standard both use the same principles and formulae.

There is also a requirement that the system / subsystem must not fail in the event of a single fault. This means that the system needs to have single fault tolerance with regard to its safety function. The most common way of achieving this requirement is to employ a dual channel architecture as shown above. In addition to this it is also required that, wherever practicable, the single fault should be detected. This requirement is the same as the original requirement for Category 3 from EN 954-1. In that context the meaning of the phrase “wherever practicable” proved somewhat problematic. It meant that Category 3 could cover everything from a system with redundancy but no fault detection [often descriptively termed “stupid redundancy”] to a redundant system where all single faults are detected. This issue is addressed in (EN) ISO 13849-1 by the requirement to estimate the quality of the Diagnostic Coverage [DC].

This is shown by the heavier dotted lines representing the monitoring functions. In essence the difference between Categories 3 and 4 is that for Category 3 most faults must be detected but for Category 4 all single dangerous faults and dangerous combinations of faults must be detected. In practice this is usually achieved by having a high level of diagnostics to ensure that all relevant faults are detected before any accumulation is possible. The DC needs to be at least 99%. Reliability Data(EN) ISO 13849-1 uses quantitative reliability data as part of the calculation of the PL achieved by the safety related parts of a control system. The ﬁ rst question this raises is “where do we get this data from?” It is possible to use data from recognised reliability handbooks but the standard makes it clear that the preferred source is the manufacturer. To this end, Rockwell Automation has made the relevant information available in the form of a data library for SISTEMA. Before we go any further we should consider what types of data are required and also gain an understanding of how it is produced.

The standard calls for the MTTFD of a single channel. This is a very different value to the MTTFD of the combination of both channels of a two channel subsystem.

An understanding of this is essential when dealing with manufacturers data. Components can be grouped into three basic types: • Mechanistic (Electro-mechanical, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic etc) • Electronic (i.e. solid state)• Software There is a fundamental difference between the common failure mechanisms of these three technology types. In basic form it can be summarised as follows:- Mechanistic Technology:Failure is proportional to both the inherent reliability and the usage rate. The greater the usage rate, the more likely that one of the component parts may be degraded and fail. Note that this is not the only failure cause, but unless we limit the operation time/cycles it will be the predominant one. It is self evident that a contactor that has switching cycle of once per ten seconds will operate reliably for a far shorter time than an identical contactor that operates one per day. 79MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 System Design According to (EN) ISO 13849 Physical technology devices generally comprise components that are individually designed for their speci ﬁ c use. The components are shaped, moulded, cast, machined etc. They are combined with linkages, springs, magnets, electrical windings etc to form a mechanism. Because the component parts do not, in general, have any history of use in other applications, we cannot ﬁ nd any pre- existing reliability data for them. The estimation of the PFH D or MTTFD for the mechanism is normally based on testing. Both EN/IEC 62061 and (EN) ISO13849-1 advocate a test process known as B10 D Testing. In the B10D test a number of device samples [usually at least ten] are tested under",

In practice it is often the case that all of the samples will fail to a safe state but in that case the standard states that the B10d [dangerous] value can be taken as twice the B10 value. Electronic Technology:There is no physical wear related to moving parts. Given an operating environment commensurate with the speci ﬁ ed electrical and temperature characteristics, the predominant failure of an electronic circuit is proportional to the inherent reliability of its constituent components [or lack off it]. There are many reasons for individual component failure; imperfection introduced during manufacture, excessive power surges, mechanical connection problems etc. In general, faults in electronic components can be caused by loading, time and temperature but are dif ﬁ cult to predict by analysis and they appear to be random in nature. Therefore testing of an electronic device in test laboratory conditions will not necessarily reveal typical long term failure patterns. In order to determine the reliability of electronic devices it is usual to use analysis and calculation. We can ﬁ nd good data for the individual components in reliability data handbooks. We can use analysis to determine which component failure modes are dangerous. It is acceptable and usual to average out the component failure modes as 50% safe and 50% dangerous. This normally results in relatively conservative data. IEC 61508 provides formulae that can be used to calculate the overall probability of dangerous failure [PFH or PFD] of the device i.e. the subsystem. The formulae are quite complex and take into account [where applicable] component reliability, potential for common cause failure [beta factor], diagnostic coverage [DC], functional test interval and proof test",

Both EN/IEC 62061 and (EN) ISO 13849-1 accept a subsystem calculated in this way to IEC 61508.

MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 80Software: Failures of software are inherently systematic in nature. Failures are caused by the way it is conceived, written or compiled. Therefore all failures are caused by the system under which it is produced, not by its use. Therefore in order to control the failures we must control that system. Both IEC 61508 and (EN) ISO 13849-1 provide requirements and methodologies for this. We do not need to go into detail here other than to say they use the classic V model. Embedded software is an issue for the designer of the device. The usual approach is to develop embedded software in accordance with the formal methods laid out in IEC 61508 part 3. When it comes to application code, the software that a user interfaces with, most programmable safety devices are provided with “certi ﬁ ed” function blocks or routines. This simpli ﬁ es the validation task for application code but it must be remembered that the completed application program still needs to be validated. The way the blocks are linked and parameterised must be proved correct and valid for the intended task. (EN) ISO 13849-1 and IEC/EN 62061 both provide guidelines for this process.

    "text": "Designated Architecture Categories 2, 3 and 4. Those Categories require some form of diagnostic testing to check whether the safety function is still working. The term “diagnostic coverage” [usually abbreviated to DC] is used to characterise the effectiveness of this testing. It is important to realise that DC is not based just on the number of components that can fail dangerously. It takes account of the total dangerous failure rate. The symbol λ is used for “failure rate”. DC expresses the relationship of the rates of occurrence of the two following types of dangerous failure; Dangerous detected failure [λdd] i.e. Those failures that would cause, or could lead to, a loss of the safety function, but which are detected. After detection, a fault reaction function causes the device or system to go to safe state. Dangerous failure [λd] i.e. All those failures that could potentially cause, or lead to, a loss of the safety function. This includes both the failures that are detected and those that are not. Of course the failures that are truly dangerous are the dangerous undetected ones [termed λdu] DC is expressed by the formula; DC = λdd/λd expressed as a percentage. This meaning of the term DC is common to (EN) ISO 13849-1 and EN/IEC 62061. However the way that it is derived differs. The latter standard proposes the use of calculation based on failure mode analysis but also allows the use of the simpli ﬁ ed method in the form of look-up tables as provided in (EN) ISO 13849-1. Various typical diagnostic techniques are listed together with the DC percentage that their use is deemed to achieve. In some cases rational judgment is still required, for example in some techniques the achieved DC is proportional to how often the test is performed. It is",

However the estimation of DC can depend on many different variables and whichever technique is used the result can usually only truly be described as approximate. It is also important to understand that the tables in (EN) ISO 13849-1 are based on extensive research conducted by the IFA into the results achieved by known, actual diagnostic techniques used in real applications. In the interest of simpli ﬁ cation the standard divides DC into four basic ranges. <60% = none60% to <90% = low90% to <99% = medium≥99% = high MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 82This approach of dealing with ranges instead of individual percentage values also can be considered to be more realistic in terms of achievable accuracy. The SISTEMA tool uses the same look-up tables as the standard. As the use of complex electronics increases in safety related devices, DC becomes a more important factor. It is likely that future work on the standards will look further into clari ﬁ cation of this issue. In the meantime the use of engineering judgment and common sense should be suf ﬁ cient to lead to the correct choice of DC range. Common Cause FailureIn most dual channel [i.e. single fault tolerant] systems or subsystems the diagnostic principle is based on the premise that there will not be dangerous failures of both channels at the same time. The term “at the same time” is more accurately expressed as “within the diagnostic test interval”. If the diagnostic test interval is reasonably short [e.g. less than eight hours] it is a reasonable assumption that two separate and unrelated faults are highly unlikely to occur within that time.

For example, if a fault in one component can foreseeably lead to failures of other components then the resulting totality of faults are deemed to be a single failure. It is also possible that an event that causes one component to fail may also cause the failure of other components. This is termed “common cause failure”, normally abbreviated as CCF. The degree of propensity for CCF is normally described as the beta ( β) factor. It is very important that subsystem and system designers are aware of the possibilities of CCF. There are many different types of CCF and, correspondingly, many different ways of avoiding it. (EN) ISO 13849-1 plots a rational course between the extremes of complexity and over simpli ﬁ cation.

The IFA SISTEMA tool also requires the implementation of the standard’s CCF look up tables and makes them available in a convenient form. Systematic FaultsWe have already discussed quanti ﬁ ed safety reliability data in the form of MTTF D and the probability of dangerous failure. However this is not the whole story. When we referred to those terms we were really thinking about failures that appear to be random in nature. Indeed IEC/EN 62061 speci ﬁ cally refers to the abbreviation of PFH D as the probability of random hardware failure. But there are some types of failures collectively known as “systematic failure” that can be attributed to errors committed in the design or manufacturing process. The classic example of this is an error in software code. The standard provides measures in Annex G to avoid these errors [and therefore the failures]. These measures include provisions such as the use of suitable materials and manufacturing techniques, reviews, analysis and computer simulation. There are also foreseeable events and characteristics that can occur in the operating environment that could cause failure unless their effect is controlled. Annex G also provides measures for this. For example it is easily foreseeable that there may be occasional losses of power. Therefore the de- energisation of components must result in a safe state for the system. These measures may seem to be just common sense, and indeed they are, but they are nevertheless essential. All the rest of the requirements of the standard will be meaningless unless due consideration is given to the control and avoidance of systematic failure. This will also sometimes require the same types of measures used for the control of random hardware failure [in order to achieve the required PFH D] such as",

The designer and user must understand how the safety system performs in the presence of faults. Many techniques are available to perform the analysis. Examples include Fault Tree Analysis; Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis; Event Tree Analysis; and Load-Strength reviews. MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 84During the analysis, certain faults may be uncovered that cannot be detected with automatic diagnostic testing without undue economic costs. Further, the probability that these faults might occur may be made extremely small because of mitigating design, construction and test methods. Under these conditions, the faults may be excluded from further consideration. Fault exclusion is the ruling out of the occurrence of a failure because the probability of that speci ﬁ c failure of the SRCS is negligible. (EN) ISO13849-1 allows fault exclusion based on the technical improbability of occurrence, generally accepted technical experience and the technical requirements related to the application. (EN) ISO13849-2 provides examples and justiﬁ cations for excluding certain faults for electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic and mechanical systems. Fault exclusions must be declared with detailed justi ﬁ cations provided in the technical documentation. It is not always possible to evaluate a Safety-Related Control System without assuming that certain faults can be excluded. For detailed information on fault exclusions, see ISO 13849-2. As the level of risk gets higher, the justi ﬁ cation for fault exclusion gets more stringent. In general, where PLe is required for a safety function to be implemented by a safety-related control system it is not normal to rely upon fault exclusions to achieve this level of performance.

The same provisions and methods apply for “mechanistic” and electronic components. In IEC/EN 62061 there is no consideration of MTTF D in years.

An analysis of the components must be undertaken to determine the probability of failure of the subsystems. Simpli ﬁ ed formulae are provided for the calculation of common subsystem architectures (described later in text). Where these formulae are not appropriate it will be necessary to use more complex calculation methods such as Markov models.

Application based information such as the anticipated number of operations per year is then required in order to convert the B10d or similar data to PFH D. 89MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 System Design According to IEC/EN 62061 NOTE: In general the following is true (taking into account a factor to change years to hours): PFHD = 1/MTTFD However, it is important to understand that, for a dual channel system (with or without diagnostics), it is not correct to use 1/ PFHD to determine the MTTFD that is required by (EN) ISO 13849-1.

This is a very different value to the MTTFD of the combination of both channels of a two channel subsystem including the effect of diagnostic coverage. Architectural ConstraintsThe essential characteristic of IEC/EN 62061 is that the safety system is divided into subsystems. The hardware safety integrity level that can be claimed for a subsystem is limited not only by the PFH D but also by the hardware fault tolerance and the safe failure fraction of the subsystems. Hardware fault tolerance is the ability of the system to execute its function in the presence of faults. A fault tolerance of zero means that the function is not performed when a single fault occurs. A fault tolerance of one allows the subsystem to perform its function in the presence of a single fault. Safe Failure Fraction is the portion of the",

Subsystem Design - IEC/EN 62061If a system designer uses components ready “packaged” into subsystems according to IEC/EN 62061 life becomes much easier because the speci ﬁ c requirements for the design of subsystems do not apply. These requirements will, in general, be covered by the device (subsystem) manufacturer and are much more complex than those required for system level design. IEC/EN 62061 requires that complex subsystems such as safety PLCs comply with IEC 61508 or other appropriate standards. This means that, for devices using complex electronic or programmable components, the full rigor of IEC 61508 applies. This can be a very rigorous and involved process. For example, 91MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 System Design According to IEC/EN 62061 the evaluation of the PFHD achieved by a complex subsystem can be a very complicated process using techniques such as Markov modelling, reliability block diagrams or fault tree analysis. IEC/EN 62061 does give requirements for the design of lower complexity subsystems. Typically this would include relatively simple electrical components such as interlock switches and electromechanical safety monitoring relays. The requirements are not as involved as those in",

IEC/EN 62061 supplies four subsystem logical architectures with accompanying formulae that can be used to evaluate the PFH D achieved by a low complexity subsystem. These architectures are purely logical representations and should not be thought of as physical architectures. The four subsystem logical architectures with accompanying formulae are shown in the following four diagrams. For a basic subsystem architecture shown below, the probabilities of dangerous failures are simply added together. Subsystem A Subsystem element 1 De1Subsystem element n Den Subsystem logical architecture A λDssA = λDe1 + ....+ λDen PFHDssA = λDssAλ Lambda is used to designate the failure rate. The units of the failure rate are failures per hour. λ D, Lambda sub D is the dangerous failure rate. λDssA, Lambda sub DssA is the dangerous failure rate of subsystem λ. Lambda sub DssA is the sum of the failure rates of the individual elements, e1, e2, e3, up to and including en. The probability of dangerous failure is multiplied by 1 hour to create the probability of failure within one hour. The next diagram shows a single fault tolerant system without a diagnostic function.

For example, a hardware fault tolerance of 1 means that 2 faults could cause a loss of the safety related control function but one fault would not. Management of Functional SafetyThe standard gives requirements for the control of management and technical activities that are necessary for the achievement of a safety related electrical control system. Proof Test IntervalThe proof test interval represents the time after which a subsystem must be either totally checked or replaced to ensure that it is in an “as new” condition. In practice, in the machinery sector, this is achieved by replacement. So the proof test interval is usually the same as lifetime. (EN) ISO 13849-1 refers to this as Mission Time. A proof test is a check that can detect faults and degradation in a SRCS so that the SRCS can be restored as close as practical to an “as new” condition”. The proof test must detect 100% of all dangerous faults including the diagnostic function (if any). Separate channels must be tested separately. In contrast to diagnostic tests, which are automatic, proof tests are usually performed manually and off line. Being automatic, diagnostic testing is performed often as compared to proof testing which is done infrequently. For example, the circuits going to an interlock switch on a guard can be tested automatically for short and open circuit conditions with diagnostic (e.g., pulse) testing. The proof test interval must be declared by the manufacturer. Sometimes the manufacturer will provide a range of different proof test intervals. It is more usual to just replace the subsystem with a new one rather that actually perform a proof test.

For example, when a fuse blows, there is a failure but it is highly probable that the failure will be to an open circuit which, in most cases, would be a “safe” failure. SFF is (the sum of the rate of “safe” failures plus the rate of detected dangerous failures) divided by (the sum of the rate of “safe” failures plus the rate of detected and undetected dangerous failures). It is important to realize that the only types of failures to be considered are those which could have some effect on the safety function. 97MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 System Design According to IEC/EN 62061 The SFF value will normally be stated by the manufacturer if it is relevant. The Safe Failure Fraction (SFF) can be calculated using the following equation: SFF = ( ∑λ S + (∑λ DD) / ((∑λ S + (∑λ D) where ∑S = the rate of safe failure, ∑λS + ∑λ D = the rate of all failure, λDD = the rate of detected dangerous failure λ D = the rate of all dangerous failure. Systematic FailureThe standard has requirements for the control and avoidance of systematic failure. Systematic failures differ from random hardware failures which are failures occurring at a random time, typically resulting from some form of degradation of parts of hardware. Typical types of possible systematic failure are software design errors, hardware design errors, requirement speci ﬁ cation errors and operational procedures. Examples of steps necessary to avoid systematic failure include • proper selection, combination, arrangements, assembly and installation of components, • use of good engineering practice; • follow manufacturer’s speci ﬁ cations and installation instructions; • ensuring compatibility between components• withstanding environmental conditions:• use of suitable materials MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety",

Categories of Control SystemsThe “Categories” of control systems originated in the former EN 954-1:1996 (ISO13849-1:1999). However they are still often used to describe the structure of safety control systems and they remain an integral part of (EN) ISO13849-1 as Designated Architectures. The description and requirements of the Categories are discussed earlier in this publication at “Overview of (EN) ISO 13849-1”. This section is intended to provide a simpli ﬁ ed but practical guide on how to implement the Category structures. Category BCategory B should be regarded as the basic foundation upon which all the other Categories are built. It does not have any special provisions or structure for safety beyond the Basic Safety Principles as given in the Annexes A to D of (EN) ISO 13849-2. These represent general good practice in design and selection of materials. Category 1 Category 1 requires the use of Well Tried Components and Well Tried Safety Principles. Shown here is a typical system intended to achieve Category 1. The interlock and the contactor play the key roles in removing energy from the motor, when access to the hazard is needed. The tongue interlock meets the requirements of IEC 60947-5-1 for direct opening action contacts, which is shown by the symbol of the arrow within the circle. With the well-tried components, the probability of energy being removed is higher for Category 1 than it would be for Category B. The use of well-tried components is intended to minimize the possibility of a loss of the safety function but note that a single fault can still lead to the loss of",

Category 2In addition to meeting the requirements of Category B and using well tried safety principles, the safety system must undergo testing to meet Category 2. The tests must be designed to detect faults within the safety related parts of the control system. If no faults are detected, the machine is allowed to run.

If this fault cannot be excluded it means that a single fault can cause the loss of the safety function. It is very important that any fault exclusion is fully justi ﬁ ed. The monitoring safety relay (MSR) provides fault diagnostics for the tongue interlock switch and for the contactors. The MSR can also facilitate other functionality such as a manual reset.

Unlike Category 3 where an accumulation of faults can lead to the loss of the safety function, Category 4 requires performance of the safety function in the presence of an accumulation of faults. In practice this is usually achieved by having a high level of diagnostics to ensure that all relevant faults are detected before any accumulation is possible. When considering a theoretical accumulation of faults, 2 faults may be suf ﬁ cient, although 3 fault consideration may be necessary for some designs. Input Logic Output WiringWiringInput Logic OutputWiringWiring Mandatory Monitorng for Fault Detection Shown here is the block diagram for Category 4. Monitoring of both output devices and cross monitoring is required.

Therefore they can be rated as safety components to meet Categories 2, 3 or 4 without any additional measures. 107MACHINERY SAFE BOOK 5 Safety-Related Control Systems, Additional Considerations Fault Considerations and Exclusions Safety analysis requires extensive analysis of faults, and a thorough understanding of the performance of the safety system in the presence of faults is needed. ISO 13849-1 and ISO 13849-2 provide details on fault considerations and fault exclusions. If a fault results in a failure of a subsequent component, the ﬁ rst fault and all the subsequent faults shall be considered a single fault.If two or more faults occur as a result of a single cause, the faults shall be considered a single fault. This is known as a common cause fault. The occurrence of two or more independent faults at the same time is considered to be highly unlikely and is not considered in this analysis. Fault Exclusions(EN) ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 permit the use of fault exclusions when determining a safety system classi ﬁ cation if it can be shown that the occurrence of the fault is extremely unlikely. It is important that where fault exclusions are used that they are properly justi ﬁ ed and are valid for the intended lifetime of the safety system. The greater the level of risk protected by the safety system then the more stringent becomes the justi ﬁ cation required for the fault exclusion. This has always caused some confusion about when certain types of fault exclusion can or cannot be used. As we have seen already in this",

    "text": "chapter, recent standards and guidance documents have clari ﬁ ed some aspects of this issue. In general, where PLe or SIL3 is speci ﬁ ed for a safety function to be implemented by a safety system ISO TR 23849 explains that it is not normal to rely upon fault exclusions to achieve this level of performance. This is dependent upon the technology used and the intended operating environment. Therefore it is essential that the designer takes additional care on the use of fault exclusions as that the PL or SIL increases. For example fault exclusion is not applicable to the mechanical aspects of electromechanical position switches and manually operated switches (e.g. an emergency stop device) in order to achieve a PLe or SIL3 system. Those fault exclusions that can be applied to speci ﬁ c mechanical fault conditions (e.g. wear/corrosion, fracture) are described in Table A.4 of ISO 13849-2. Therefore a guard interlocking system that has to achieve PLe or SIL3 will need to incorporate a minimum fault tolerance of 1 (e.g. two conventional mechanical position switches) in order to achieve this level of performance since it is not normally justi ﬁ able to exclude faults, such as, broken switch actuators. However, it may be acceptable to exclude faults, such as short circuit of wiring within a control panel designed in accordance with relevant standards.

    "text": "“Stop Categories” that originated in IEC/EN 60204-1 and NFPA 79. There are three Stop Categories. Stop Category 0 requires immediate removal of power to the actuators. This is sometimes considered as an uncontrolled stop because, in some circumstances, motion can take some time to cease because the motor may be free to coast to a stop. Stop Category 1 requires that power is retained to apply braking until the stop is achieved and then remove power to the actuator. Note: See IEC 60204-1 for information on Stop Categories 1a and 1b. Stop Category 2 is a controlled stop with power left available to the machine actuators. A normal production stop is considered a category 2 stop . Note that only Stop Categories 0 or 1 can be used as emergency stops. The choice of which of the two Categories to use should be dictated by a risk assessment. All the circuit examples shown so far in this chapter have used a Stop Category 0. A Stop Category 1 is achieved with a time-delayed output for the ﬁ nal removal of power. An interlocked guard with guardlocking often accompanies a Category 1 stop system. This keeps the guard locked in a closed position until the machine has reached a safe (i.e., stopped) state. Stopping a machine without taking proper account of the programmable controller may affect restarting and could result in tool and machine damage. A standard (non safety) PLC alone cannot be relied on for a safety related stopping task; therefore, other approaches need to be considered. Two possible solutions for category 1 stopping are given below: 1. Safety Relay with Time Delayed Override Command A safety relay with both immediate acting and delayed action outputs is used.

U.S. Safety Control System RequirementsControl ReliableThe highest level of risk reduction in the U.S. and Canadian robot standards is achieved by safety related control systems meeting the requirements of Control Reliable. Control reliable safety related control systems are dual channel architectures with monitoring. The stopping function of the robot must not be prevented by any single component failure, including the monitoring function. The monitoring shall generate a stop command upon detection of a fault. If a hazard remains after motion stops, a warning signal must be provided. The safety system must remain in a safe state until the fault is corrected. Preferably, the fault is detected at the time of the failure. If this cannot be achieved, then the failure must be detected at the next demand on the safety system. Common mode failures must be taken into consideration if a signi ﬁ cant probability of such a failure can occur. The Canadian requirements differ from the U.S. requirement by adding two additional requirements.",

    "text": "First, the safety related control systems shall be independent of the normal program control systems. Second, the safety system must not be easily defeated or bypassed without detection. Comments on Control ReliableThe most fundamental aspect of Control Reliable is single fault tolerance and monitoring (fault detection). The requirements state how the safety system must respond in the presence of “a single fault,” “any single fault,” or “any single component failure.” Three very important concepts must be considered regarding faults: (1) not all faults are detected, (2) adding the word “component” raises questions about wiring, and(3) wiring is an integral part of the safety system. Wiring faults can result in the lossof a safety function. MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 110The intent of Control Reliability is clearly the performance of the safety function in the presence of a fault. If the fault is detected, then the safety system must execute a safe action, provide noti ﬁ cation of the fault, and prevent further operation of the machine until the fault is corrected. If the fault is not detected, then the safety function must still be performed upon demand.

Veriﬁ cation and Validation Plan Veriﬁ cation and validation play important roles in the avoidance of faults throughout the safety system design and development process. ISO 13849-2 sets the requirements for veri ﬁ cation and validation. The standard calls for a documented plan to con ﬁ rm that all of the safety functional requirements have been met. Veriﬁ cation is an analysis of the resulting safety control system. The Performance Level (PL) of the safety control system is calculated to con ﬁ rm that the system meets the required Performance Level (PLr) speci ﬁ ed. The SISTEMA software is typically used to perform the calculations and assist with satisfying the requirements of ISO 13849-1. Validation is a functional test of the safety control system to demonstrate that the system meets the speciﬁ ed requirements of the safety function. The safety control system is tested to conﬁ rm that all of the safety-related outputs respond appropriately to their corresponding safety-related inputs. The functional test includes normal operating conditions in addition to potential fault injection of failure modes. A checklist is typically used to document the validation of the safety control system. Prior to validating the system, con ﬁ rm that the Guardmaster 440C-CR30 conﬁ gurable safety relay has been wired and con ﬁ gured in accordance with the installation instructions.

The same standards are also recognized in many areas outside Europe, for example, through equivalency charts, which facilitates machinery trade and machine shipments between countries within and even outside the EU. Machine safety is one of the most rapidly growing areas of importance in industrial automation. New and improved safety strategies offer manufacturers a way of improving their productivity and competitiveness in the market. Safety becomes an integrated part of machine functionality, rather than after-thoughts added to meet regulations. Area of growing importance 5 Safety and functional safety | ABB brochure 1SFC001008B0201Functional safety systems implemented through defined processes and using certified sub-systems to achieve specific safety performance are thus becoming a must in the marketplace. This general guide describes the standards that must be taken into account when designing a machine in order to achieve func-tional safety. It explains, in general terms, the process for meeting the requirements of the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC and how CE marking, which indicates that the machinery conforms to these requirements, is attained. In the context of this guide, the purpose of safety is to protect people from harm. Functional safety achieves this via systems that lower the probability of undesired events, thereby minimizing mishaps. Safety standards define safety as freedom from unacceptable risk. The most effective way to eliminate risks is to design them away. But as risk reduction by design is not always possible or practical, safeguarding with static guards are often the next best option, and for several reasons. Stopping a machine quickly and safely, not only reduces risk but also increases machine uptime and productivity compared with abrupt safety stops. At the same time, the legal obligations are met and",

    "text": "the safety of people and the environment is ensured. Functional safety in machinery usually means systems that safely monitor and, when necessary, override the machine applications to ensure safe operation. A safety-related system thus implements the required safety functions by detecting hazardous conditions and bringing operation to a safe state, by ensuring that a desir ed action, e.g. safe stopping, takes place.Safety system monitoring can include machine speed, direction of rotation, stopping and standstill. When executing a safety function, e.g. monitoring a crawl speed that deviates from the expected value (i.e. is too fast), the safety system detects this deviation and actively returns machine operation to a safe state by, for example, stopping the machine safely and removing the torque from the motor shaft. Any failure in the safety system will immediately increase risks related to machine operation. Role of the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC The Machinery Directive, with the harmonized standards listed under it, defines the Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSR) for machinery at European Union level. The idea behind the Machinery Directive is to ensure that a machine is designed and constructed to be safe so that it can be used, configured and maintained throughout all phases of its life, causing minimal risk to people and the environment. The EHSR state that machine manufacturers must apply the following principles in the given order: –Eliminate or minimize hazards as much as resonable possible by considering safety aspects in machine design and construction phases. –Apply necessary protection measures against hazards that cannot be eliminated. –Inform users of the risks that remain despite all feasible protection measures being taken, while specifying any requirements for training or personal protective equipment.Introdution Safety and functional safety 6 Safety and functional safety | ABB brochure 1SFC001008B0201Two standards ISO and IEC Two new standards Machine manufacturers",

    "text": "implementing functional safety systems in compliance with the Machinery Directive can follow one of two alternative European standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). These are designated EN ISO 13849-1 and EN 62061 respectively. EN 62061 is applicable only to electrical control systems. Both replace the old standard EN 954-1, which will become obsolete on December 31, 2011, after a 3+2-year allowable transition period. Furthermore, both fall under the basic safety of machinery standards for risk-minimization (EN ISO 12100-1:2003) and risk-assessment in risk-reduction (EN ISO 14121-1:2007). Figure 1 illustrates this hierarchy. The standards for electronic safety systems are formally designated as follows: EN ISO 13849- 1:2008 (Safety of machinery – Safety-related parts of control system – General Principles for design), EN 62061:2005 (Safety of machinery – Functional safety of safety-r elated electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems). References to these standards in this document always apply to the above-mentioned versions. Manufacturers can choose which – if any – of the two safety system standards to use (i.e. ISO 13849-1 or EN 62061). However, to ensure congruity, it is recommended to follow the same, chosen standard all the way from beginning to end. Following either standard leads to a very similar outcome and their resulting safety integrity levels (SIL) and performance levels (PL) are comparable (see Table 7). This document includes safety performance/integrity examples for both standards. ISO 13849-1 – for making machines safe ISO 13849-1 provides instructions to designers to make machines safe. These instructions include recommendations for system design, integration and validation. The standard can be used for the safety-related parts of control systems and various kinds of machinery, regardless of the technology or energy source used. It also includes special requirements for safety-related parts that have programmable electronic systems. This",

However, as zero risk can never be achieved in practice, the key objective is to minimize risk. Compliance with this goal can be achieved: –By meeting the requirements set by the harmonized standards, or –By having a machine acceptance investigation carried out by an authorized third party. Achieving and managing functional safety Achieving functional safety that fulfills the EHSR of the Machinery Directive, i.e. the first of the above alternatives, involves several steps, all of which must consider the system as a whole as well as the environment with which it interacts. These steps include risk assessment, identification of required safety functions risk reduction through implementing the safety function, and ensuring that the safety function performs as intended. All functional safety activities must be managed during the lifecycle of the machine. A project management and quality management system specified in the form of a safety plan will help meet these goals. Safety plan A safety plan for meeting the requirements of the Machinery Directive is specified in EN 62061. It identifies all relevant activities, describes the policy and strategy for fulfilling functional safety requirements, identifies responsibilities, identifies or establishes procedures and resources for documentation, describes a strategy for configuration management, and includes plans for verification and validation.

Each of these seven steps is explained in more detail below.Note: Unlike EN 62061, ISO 13849-1 does not specify the safety plan activities listed above.

    "text": "taken into account when designing a machine. Any risk considered ‘high’ must be reduced to an acceptable level via design changes or by applying appropriate safety measures. The assessment process helps machinery designers design inherently safe machinery. Assessing risks at the design phase is very important as it is generally more effective than providing user instructions on how to operate the equipment safely. Risk assessment according to ISO 12100-1 (the safety of machinery standards for risk-minimization, see Fig. 1) consists of two parts: risk analysis and risk evaluation. Risk analysis means identifying and estimating the risks, risk evaluation means deciding whether the risk is acceptable, or if risk reduction is necessary. Risk evaluation thus depends on the results of the risk analysis. Similarly, decisions regarding the necessity of risk reduction are made according to the risk evaluation procedure. Note that risk evaluation must be carried out separately for each identified hazar d. Fig. 2 outlines the risk analysis and evaluation steps according to ISO 14121-1, the safety of machinery standards for risk-assessment in risk-reduction (see Fig. 1). The limits of the machine referred to in Fig. 2 include limits of use, spatial limits, ambient or environmental limits, and lifetime limits. Estimating risk severity covers its potential consequences, while risk probability covers frequency, probability and avoidance. If the outcome of the risk analysis and evaluation outlined in Fig. 2 is YES, the risk reduction target is considered met and the risk process ends. In the latter case, the machine has reached the adequate level of safety required by the Machinery Directive. If the outcome is NO, i.e. the risk remains unacceptable, apply risk reduction measures and then return to step 2 in the risk analysis. Fig 2. Risk assessment and evaluation according to ISO 14121-1.

However, if this is not possible, reduce risks and ensure conformance in accordance with the Machinery Directive requirements by applying the harmonized standards under it. ISO 12100-1 divides the method for risk reduction into three main steps: –Inherently safe design measures (creating a safer design, changing the process). –Safeguarding and complementary protective measures (safety functions, static guarding). –Information for use (warning signs, signals and devices on the machine and in the operating instructions, protective measures taken by the user for example training). Fig. 2 illustrates this three-step risk-reduction workflow. Fig. 2 Risk reduction according to ISO 12100-1. Always document residual (remaining) risks in the operating instructions. The latter aspect (information on use) is called residual risk management. Residual risk is the risk that remains when all protective measures have been considered and implemented. Technology measures alone are never able to achieve a state of zero risk, hence some residual risk always remains. These risks must be documented in the operating instructions. Machine-users and organizations have an important role to play in risk reduction and are generally provided with relevant information by the machine designer (manufacturer). Reduction measures commonly undertaken by an organization include: –Introducing safe working procedures, work supervision and permit-to-work systems. –Provision and use of additional safeguards. –Use of personal protective equipment. –User training. –Ensuring that operating and safety instructions are read",

Simply put, it is a measure taken to reduce the likelihood of an unwanted event occurring and exposing a hazard. A safety function is not part of machine operation: if such a function fails, the machine can still operate normally, but the risk of injury from its operation increases. Defining a safety function is a key issue. This always includes two components: –Action (what must be done to reduce the risk). –Safety performance (SIL or PL – Safety Integrity Level and Performance Level respectively). Example of a safety function: Hazard: An exposed rotating shaft may cause injury if a person gets too close. Action: To prevent personal injury, the motor must stop within one (1) second from opening the safety gate. After the safety function that executes the action has been identified, its required safety level is determined as described below. This completes defining the safety function. Safety performance/integrity Safety integrity measures the performance of a safety function. It helps quantify the likelihood of the safety function being achieved when requested. The required safety integrity for a function is",

SIL and PL use different evaluation techniques for a safety function, but their results are comparable and the terms and definitions are similar for both. How to determine the required SIL (EN 62061) This process is as follows: 1. Determine the severity of the consequence of a hazardous event. 2. Determine the point value for the frequency and duration the person is exposed to harm. 3. Determine the point value for the probability of the hazardous event occurring when exposed to it. 4. Determine the point value for the possibility of preventing or limiting the scope of the harm.Note: A safety function must be specified, verified (functionality and safety performance) and validated separately for each identified hazard.Additional safeguarding needs to be specified once the risk reduction that can be achieved via design changes has been obtained.

Frequency (Fe) is thus high = 5. –It is possible that the hazard will take place. Therefore probability (Pr) = 3. –The hazard can be avoided, so avoidance (Av) = 3. –The sum of Fe, Pr and Av (5 + 3 + 3) = 11. –The determined consequence of the hazard is permanent injury, possibly loss of fingers. Hence severity (Se) = 3. How to determine the required PL (ISO 13849-1) PL is an alternative parameter to SIL. To determine the required PL, select one of the alternatives from the following categories and create a ‘path’ to the required PL in the risk graph (Fig. 3), which lists the resulting performance level as a, b, c, d or e. Determine the severity of injury/damage: –S1 Slight, usually reversible injury –S2 Severe, usually irreversible injury, including death Determine the frequency and duration of exposure to the hazard: –F1 Rare to often and/or short exposure –F2 Frequently to continuous and/or long exposure Determine the possibility of preventing the hazard or limiting the damage caused by the hazard: –P1 Possible under certain conditions –P2 Hardly possible Example: Hazard analysis for an exposed rotating shaft. –The consequence is severe, irreversible injury.

Using certified sub-systems when constructing functional safety systems could save safety system designers a lot of work. For example, implementing safety functions is more convenient when certain safety and reliability calculations are already made and the sub-systems are certified. Implementation and verification processes are iterative and run parallel with each other. Use verification as a tool during implementation to ensure that the defined safety level is reached with the implemented system. For more information on verification, see Step 4: Verify functional safety. Several calculation software programs for verifying functional safety systems are available. These programs make creating and verifying the system more convenient. The general steps for implementing a functional safety system include: 1. Defining the safety requirements as SIL or PL according to standard EN 62061 or EN ISO 13849-1. 2. Selecting the system architecture to be used for the safety system. ISO 13849-1 and EN 62061 standards offer basic architectures with calculation formulas.

The system needs to be installed properly to avoid common failure possibilities due to improper wiring, environmental, or other such factors. A safety system that does not perform correctly due to careless installation is of little use. It may even pose a risk in itself.Step 3: Implement functional safety Note: If certified sub-systems are not used, it may be necessary to carry out safety calculations for each sub-system.

Machines can cause a variety of injuries ranging from minor abrasions, burns or cuts to severe injuries such as fractures, laceraƟons, crushing injuries or even amputa Ɵon. Machine guards are your ﬁrst line of defense against injuries caused by machine operaƟon. Each machine must have adequate safeguards to protect operators and other employees in the immediate work area from hazards created by ingoing nip points, rota Ɵng parts, sparks and ﬂ ying debris. Pinch points and shear points would include power transmission apparatuses such as: ﬂywheels, pulleys, belts, chains, couplings, spindles, cams, gears, connecƟng rods and other machine components that transmit energy. Having an understanding of how a machine works, and how the guards can protect you, will result in a reduced risk of injury. As an employee you may become accustomed to doing things in a certain way or have tasks ﬂ owing a certain way and grow oblivious to the hazards that may be ever present around your piece of equipment. With complacency there is a sense of numbness that develops to hazards. Employees must be on guard and not become complacent in the workplace. All guards should: PREVENT CONTACT – machine guards must provide a physical barrier that prevents the operator from having any part of his/her body in the “danger zone” during the machine’s operaƟ ng cycle; BE SECURED IN PLACE – machine guards must be secure and strong so that workers are not able to bypass, remove, or tamper with them.

The Per- formance Level is dependent upon the control system's structure (Category), as well as the systematic requirements. For this purpose, the IFA provides the SISTEMA software tool (the German acronym stands for \"safety of controls on machines”), which can be downloaded free of charge from www.dguv.de/ifa, Webcode e34183 . Before beginning the ca lculations, the machine design engineer must produce a safety- related block diagram for each safety functi on from the circuit diagram. The safety-related block diagram must show the implementation of the safety function in functional channels (including redundant channels, where present) and testing components, also where present. The SISTEMA Cookbook 1 addresses this unfamiliar and difficult abstraction step (Figure 1) and the subsequent step, that of transferring the blocks to SISTEMA and entering their pa- rameters.

They also include all test facilities responsible for detecting such dangerous failures and bringing about a safe state. A sche- matic circuit diagram shows for example the el ectrical circuitry of position switches, pro- grammable logic controllers (PLCs) and contactors, and the flow of current from the sensor, via signal processing, to the actuator. Example 1 (Figure 2) shows an implementation of the safety function for \"opening of the movable guard initiates the safe torque off (STO) safety function\".

In the course of the transformation, the components of the schematic circuit diagram are assigned to \"subsystems\" with which the safety function is modelled in SISTEMA. In the presentation as a safety-related block diagram the logical interrelationships are rele- vant rather than the physical connections between the components. Each component within a safety function is a constituent part of a certain structure. This structure is termed a \"Cate- gory\" in EN ISO 13849-1, and grouped within SISTEMA as a subsystem. The sequences of subsystems with their corresponding Categories are represented by a safety function in the form of a safety-related block diagram. The sequence of the subsystems has no bearing upon subsequent calculation of the probability of failure. 3.1 Categories to EN ISO 13849-1 The Categories to EN ISO 13849-1, their characterizing features and their typical representa-tion are shown in Table 1.

The procedure described here is geared to the application of EN ISO 13849-1 and its \"desig-nated architectures\" for the Categories. If modelling to one of the categories is not possible, even when additional components or channels are omitted, the simplified method described in the standard cannot be applied. In this case, the probability of failure must be verified with recourse to other methods, such as Markov modelling, as described in EN 61508-6, Annex B.

An encapsulated subsystem can be recognized as such by the fact that it is already charac- terized by the manufacturer by a PL (or SIL in accordance with IEC standards), PFH and Category (internal structure). The internal structure of the encapsulated subsystem need not be deconstructed further. Note: If a Category 3 or 4 encapsulated subsystem occupies in both redundant functional channels, both functional channels pass through it. Step 4: Can all component faults be excluded? All assumed faults for the component in the bl ock under analysis are considered in turn. For this purpose, the annex of EN ISO 13849-2 contains the fault models of a number of compo- nents used in machine controls. Owing to justified fault exclusions, certain component faults can be discounted. For each fault case, it must be considered whether the intended safety- related functionality of the component is retained (harmless fault) or fails (dangerous fault). A dangerous fault exists for example for contactor Q2 in Example 1 (Figure 3) when the safety door is opened but Q2 fails to drop out because its contacts have welded. Should no dangerous faults whatsoever need to be assumed for the component, no value exists for calculation of the PFH of the safety function. It need not be considered in the safety-related block diagram. Further present ation of the safety function can however be constructive, since it may be conducive to an understanding of it. In this case, the block is treated as an encapsulated subsystem (\"fault exclusion\" is then subsequently ticked in SISTEMA, and further entries are not required). Step 5: Is the safety function retained in the event of component faults? The dangerous faults to be assumed for the component in the block under analysis are determined in Step 4. Their",

In Example 1 (Figure 3), this applies to both B1 and Q2. The redundant functional channel B2-K1-Q1 is therefore added to both blocks. Note: The components of the redundant functional channel are thus used several times. This is a result of the phased procedure and should not be a hindrance at this stage. Blocks of which multiple instances exist are grouped together again in Step 8. If redundant components have been entered, a major basic criterion for Categories 3 and 4 has been met. A single fault in a component of the first or second functional channel must not result in loss of the safety function (single-fault tolerance). Note: In addition, Category 3 requires that, w herever reasonably possible, individual faults in components within the two functional channels should be detected. Step 5b: Is the safety function retained in the event of an accumulation of undetected faults?

    "text": "For this purpose, the behaviour in the event of undetected faults occurring must be studied. If the safety function is retained in the event of an accumulation of two undetected faults, the subsystem satisfies Category 4. If the safety function is not retained at the second undetected fault, the subsystem satisfies Category 3. In Example 1 (Figure 3), PLC K1 could actuate outputs O1.0 and O1.1 continuously in the event of a fault. Q1 would be continually energized in this case. Even if the PLC were able to detect this fault by reading back of the monitoring contacts, it would not be able to bring about the safe state. Should a second fault then cause the contacts of Q2 to weld, the motor would continue to run even with the protective equipment open; the safety function has failed, and Category 4 is not met. Note: In Category 4, single-fault tolerance must be satisfied and the discrete fault in a com- ponent in the first or second functional channel must be detected at or before the next demand upon the safety function. If detection in this way is not possible, an accumu- lation of two undetected faults must not lead to loss of the safety function. Step 6: Are component faults detected? At this point, it is clear that there is no redundancy and that consequently neither Category 3 nor Category 4 is met. If failure of a block in a test channel is detected by a test channel and the safe state is brought about, the subsystem satisfies Category 2. In Example 2 (Figure 4), tripping of B0 causes controlled stopping of the motor by T1/G1 within 1/3 of a rotation.

The test channel G2-K1-Q1 thus detects faults in B0 and T1/G1 and brings about the safe state; Category 2 is thus met. Note: Reasonable fault detection is also a requirement for Categories 3 and 4. Conversely, Category 2 subsystems lack a redundant functional channel. SISTEMA Cookb ook (Version 1.0) - 13 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 14 - Step 6a: Adding the test channel of the block The components of the test channel which detect failure of the block and bring about the safe state are presented in the safety-related block diagram as test blocks as shown in Table 1 (Category 2) If components are entered in the test channel, a major basic criterion for Category 2 is met: the safety function must be tested at suitable intervals. This causes the loss of the safety function to be detected and a safe state to be brought about by an independent disconnect-ing device. A further important requirement for Category 2 is the test frequency (see BGIA Report 2/2008e, Section 6.25). However this is not relevant to the structural analysis. Step 7: Is the component \"well-tried\"? Redundancy or testing was not found in the example. Only Category 1 or Category B are therefore possible. Should the component in the block under analysis be a \"well-tried\" com-ponent to EN ISO 13849, the block is presented as part of a Category 1 subsystem.

The procedure otherwise continues at Step 9. Step 9: Grouping blocks of the same category Subsystems of the same category can be merged by the grouping of components of identical channels (see BGIA Report 2/2008, Figure 6.14). Each component occurs only once within a channel; duplicates can be removed. The same component clearly cannot be used simulta- neously in two redundant functional channels. In Category 2, only components which share the same test channel can be grouped in a functional channel. Since SISTEMA limits MTTF dvalues of each channel within the subsystems (capping), grouping may result in a lower probability of a dangerous failure per hour being calculated. The lower probability of failure (PFH) is an advantage. A disadvantage however is that the grouped representation often makes it more difficult to follow the logical sequence of signal processing. The examples in Chapter 2 yield the safety-related block diagrams in Figure 5a: Figure 5a: Result of the structural anal ysis for the examples from Chapter 2 The safety function is now presented logically on the safety-related block diagram.

This guide describes the creation, publication and use of these libraries. The terms \"database\" and \"library\" are used synonymously in this guide. Two different for - mats must be distinguished within SISTEMA: • The \"SISTEMA library\" (abbreviation: SIS -lib) is in SISTEMA's own format. These are files of the type \".slb\". • From SISTEMA Version 2 onwards, a further format to VDMA Specification 66413 is supported (abbreviation: \"VDMA -lib\"; see Annex B). These files are of the type \".xml\". This guide is intended for several groups of readers: • Manufacturers of components (such as safety components or contactors): these compa-nies wish to communicate the reliability parameters of their products to users by means of the libraries . Although these companies may themselves be users of SISTEMA, their role is described in this cookbook as that of \"manufacturer\" . • Control system manufacturers: these companies use the products referred to above to produce complete safety -related control systems in accordance with EN ISO 13849 -1 1. The manufacturers' libraries are required for analysis of these control systems. The con - trol system manufacturers may however themselves be manufacturers of discrete parts of control systems (produced for example from standard components), and may also cre-ate SIS TEMA libraries for these parts of control systems for their own use. The role of these control system manufacturers is however described throughout this cookbook as that of \"user\" . This group also includes persons and companies who",

The corresponding documentation can be supplemented with a machine- specific SIS -lib for this purpose. The operator's role will be described below as that of \"operator\" . Introductory information for all target readerships can be found in Chapters 2 and 3. Section 3.1 outlines the typical activities associated with the libraries, with cross -references to more detailed information in the relevant chapters. Chapters 4 to 8 are intended primarily for the users; Chapters 10 to 13 primarily for the manu facturers. If you use SISTEMA and wish to produce SIS TEMA libraries of your own, you should also read Chapters 10 and 11. Chapter 9 provides information for operators who need to extend a safety control system or replace components of it during the mission time of a machine. The annexes in Chapter 14 contain further information and useful tables. Understanding application of the EN ISO 13849 series of standards is essential for work with SISTEMA and the libraries. The same applies to the use of other analysis tools.

The tool, which runs on Microsoft Windows, enables users to model the structure of the safety -related parts of control systems (SRP/CS) based upon the specified \"designated architectures\", thereby permitting auto - mated calculation of the reliability values at various levels of detail, including that of the attained Performance Level (PL). Relevant parameters, such as the risk parameters for determining the required Performance Level (PL r), the Category of the SRP/CS, measures against common -cause failures (CCFs) on multi -channel systems, the average component quality (MTTF D) and the average test quality (DC) of components are entered step by step in input dialogs. Once the necessary data have been entered into SISTEMA, the results are computed and displayed. A practical advantage in use is that t he effects of a given parameter change upon the system as a whole are displayed immediately in the user interface. The otherwise time- consuming",

Users of SISTEMA can therefore vary parameter values with a minimum of effort in order to assess the effect of modifications. The final results are summarized in a report, which can be printed out. User -friendly library functions complete SISTEMA's range of features. Almost al l leading manufacturers of components provide SISTEMA libraries (SIS -lib) of their products' data. The first libraries became available in 2008; by the middle of 2016 , 65 companies were already listed on the IFA's website with links to their libraries. Libraries can be stored either on a local PC or centrally on a company's servers, from where they can be loaded. Users of SISTEMA can however create libraries of their own, in which they can manage parts of control systems that they have developed themsel ves, or fre - quently used components. This is possible only with SISTEMA libraries, however; VDMA libraries may be made available only by the manufacturer of the control products themselves. Like those of many CAE 2 programs, SISTEMA's libraries are an ess ential factor for effective, efficient and error -free engineering. The engineering task in this context is the analysis of safety controls. Such analyses are however time- consuming in the early stages. For a once - off analysis, the reliability data could be read off a data sheet and typed into a SISTEMA project. Where numerous safety functions are used repeatedly in the same or slightly modi - fied form, however, it must be possible for the analysis to be performed rapidly and automati - cally. Ideally, a complex part of a control system is defined, documented and verified only once. It is then archived in the SIS- lib and retrieved again in the",

The new convention is \"PFH D\" (refer also to 0). 2 Introduction SISTEMA Coo kbook 5 (Version 2.0) 9 / 85 why the SISTEMA library was defined. The database published in 2012 in VDMA Specifica - tion 66413 (see Annex B ) was defined for the same purpose. An exclusive feature of the SISTEMA s olution is the additional facility for parts of control systems pre- engineered by the user to be saved together with all their components, their parameters, and the associated documentation – in a similar way to the circuit diagram macros of CAE pro - grams. Not only is the final result (PFH D and Performance Level) stored, but also the com - plete single or two- channel structure and the documentation of all parts contained in the system. This supports use in the field: such \"macros\" cannot always be used as -is, since a discrete component of a complex part of a control system must be substituted, added or removed. SISTEMA supports this redesign process, however with the SIS -libs. Manufacturers who initially only intended to offer SIS -libs for their products can i n addition use SIS -libs to distribute more complex parts of control systems and their components in",

The data structure and data fields of the SIS -lib were defined solely by the IFA; they are therefore proprietary. Only the IFA develops them further; it does so however taking account of proposals made by manufacturers, drawing upon experience from the field and technical progress (such as VDMA 66413). The documentation of the SISTEMA data structure for SIS -lib and projects p rovided for developers is available from the IFA free of charge upon request.

Introductory information on the concept and user interface of the libraries can be found in Chapters 3 , 4 and 5 . Manufacturers' libraries are first generated by the manufacturers (activity A, see Chapters 10 to 12). These libraries must be made available for use (usually by publication on the manu- facturer's website). These pages can most easily be found via the IFA's list of links (activity B, Chapter 13 ).

The IFA develops SISTEMA (activity F) and hosts it for download on its website (activity G). Other enterprises or organizations are not permitted to host SISTEMA in this way. 3.2 Sources of reliability parameters For the analysis of safety -related machine controls, parameters are required for standard components (MTTF D, λD, B10D etc.) etc. and for parts of control systems (PL, SIL, PFH D etc.), which may also be safety components. An index of these abbreviations can be found in 0 of this cookbook. Annex C of EN ISO 13849- 1 describes prioritization: preference is to be given to the component manufacturer's data. If this is not possible, typical parameters from stand - ards or databases are used. These values can be obtained from a number of sources: • The manufacturer's data sheets or certificates: this has been the typical source to date. These values can be copied and entered directly into the SISTEMA project. In order to simplify re -use and to prevent errors from occurring, they should be copied – following careful validation – into a SISTEMA user library. The values can also be entered directly in the tabs of the library. • The manufacturer's electronic library: this is the ideal source.",

Alternatively, the manufacturer's components that are frequently used can be copied into a dedicated SISTEMA user library. • Values from standards (such as EN ISO 13849 -1): these values can also be entered into a SISTEMA user library. The typical values of EN ISO 13849- 1, Table C.1 and those of IEC 61508 4 are already stored in a SISTEMA input dialog, from where they can be called up directly (No SIS -lib, see Block/Element object, \"MTTF D\" tab). • Databases of components (such as SN 295005, IEC/TR 623806): these values, too, can be imported into a SISTEMA user library. EN ISO 13849 -1:2008, Tables C.2 to C.7 also provides typical values for semi conductors and passive electrical components. Further databases are cited in the bibliography of EN ISO 13849- 1. 3.3 Differences between SISTEMA users' and manufacturers' libraries Both users and manufacturers can therefore create SIS -libs and distribute them to third par - ties. The SIS -libs in these two cases are technically identical. Differences may arise between the way the SIS -libs are created; for large- scale databases, manufacturers will prefer other methods to the integrated editor (see Chapter 12 ). These methods are in principle available to users, however. Manufacturers generally write- protect their SIS -libs in order to prevent inadvertent manipulation (see Section 11.6). Write -prote ction is also recommended when SIS-libs are distributed within larger working groups or to customers/suppliers. 4 IEC 61508: Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety -related systems. 5 SN 29500 (calculation of the failure rates of electronic equipment) 6 IEC 62380: R eliability Prediction 3 Library structure and interfaces to it SISTEMA",

For re-use in user libraries, complex parts of control systems are more likely to be saved (Figure 3): in SISTEMA, these are \"sub- systems\", comprising multiple components. Manufacturers may however equally supply SIS- libs comprising application examples (blocks or subsystems) together with their products. And as already described in Section 3.2, users can still create their own libraries containing component parameters when a manufacturer's SIS-lib for them does not exist.

It divides a channel into logical functional units (such as sensor, logic and main contactor). The block can however also constitute a single component.  The element (EL) is the lowest hierarchical level of the objects.

Copying of objects between the object trees in the main window and the library window is also possible in both directions by drag and drop, i.e. by dragging an object with the left mouse button depressed. A general rule is that objects may be inserted only at suitable points. The paste operation is not otherwise performed, or the \"Paste\" or \"Load\" commands are not active, but greyed out. The following constraints apply:  An element can be inserted only into a block.  A block can be inserted only into a channel/test channel.  A subsystem can be inserted only into a safety function.

The \"View -> Context\" menu item (Ctrl+K) hides and unhides this window. 4.2.5 The status of objects Objects are marked with their current status before the object name in the various areas of the user interface. SISTEMA differentiates between three states:  A green tick indicates that no warnings, errors, inconsistencies or unsatisfied condi- tions are active for the object concerned. Information in the message pane should how- ever be observed.  A yellow dot indicates that at least one warning is active for the object (see message pane).  A red cross indicates that the object exhibits at least one error, inconsistency, or unsatisfied condition (see message pane). The status of an object is inherited by the object on the next level up in the hierarchy. The status with the highest priority takes precedence. The highest priority is the red status, the lowest the green status. Should a library contain objects with red status, analysis is not possible or has not been completed successfully. When objects have the yellow status, the user of the objects must observe the warning mes- sages. The analysis has however been completed successfully. 4.2.6 The message pane Like the main SISTEMA window, the message pane (Figure 12) contains information, warn- ing and error messages concerning the selected object.

Double-click on a message to jump to the object concerned; this object then becomes the current selection. An object for which no messages exist also has green status, but is not shown in the mes- sage pane. In the example (Figure 12), \"Channel 1\" contains a green message. \"Channel 2\" contains no message, but the objects \"BL1\" and \"BL2\" in Channel 2 have messages with yellow status. \"Channel 2\" thus has the overall status of yellow, which is shown in the navigation pane. 4.2.7 The toolbar The toolbar (Figure 13) is located directly below the menu bar.

Further infor- mation on this function can be found in SISTEMA Cookbook 2 (see Section 7.2).  \"Close Library\": removes the selected SIS-lib from the list.

The \"View - > Context“ and \"View - > Message \" menu items unhide and hide these windows. \"Refresh\" updates the complete object tree in the navigation pane.

Up to and including Version 1.1.2, libraries had to be present on the local hard drive, since the simple \"embedded\" version of the \"Firebird\" open database technology was used for accessing these files. This \"local\" variant of a Firebird server assumes exclusive access to the file. This is not assured in the case of a network drive. The Firebird server has been supported since SISTEMA Version 1.1.3. With this variant, the libraries are managed by a \"true\" database server that enables manufacturers' databases to be hosted centrally where they can be used by several people simultaneously on a network. A guide to this arrangement can be found in SISTEMA Cook book 2. The internal database files for the SISTEMA installation can also be stored on this database server, besides the libraries.

Once the server PC hosting the libraries and the lists has been configured and a network connection is available to the server PC, the libraries can be opened. A description follows of the two options, i.e. entering a single library or a list of several libraries. The SISTEMA library window contains the \"Add Network Library\" command. This command calls u p a dialog ( Figure 30) in which you can enter the library parameters, check the status of the library, and add it to the list of libraries.

A URL (i.e. a web address, e.g. \"http://www.sample_company.com/Document.pdf“) may be available, or a relative path to a project folder (e.g. \".. \\sample_company \\Document.pdf\"). Absolute paths such as \"L:\\sample_company \\Document.pdf\" are unlikely to occur in manufacturers' libraries. These cases can be handled as follows: • URL: either leave unchanged (the URL continues to be valid), or back up the document by loading it from the URL and copying it into the project folder. For the sake of com - pleteness, then assign this document to the project by means of the \"Document\" input field. This ensures that the document can still be opened in the future even should the URL cease to be valid. The URL could in this case then be copied, for example into the \"Documentation\" field. • Relative path: copy the manufacturers' documents into the project fol der (\"..\\Documents \\<relative path>\") and check that the document can be opened correctly 7 Working with SISTEMA libraries SISTEMA Coo kbook 5 (Version 2.0) 44 / 85 from within the object in the project.

This can be achieved by several different methods, which are described below. These methods do not enable an object to be moved, i.e. deleted from the SIS -lib. Objects can be deleted from the SIS -lib only by means of the \"Delete\" command, and t hen only if the SIS -lib is not write -protected. A general rule is that objects may be inserted only at suitable points. The paste operation is not otherwise performed, or the \"Paste\" or \"Load\" commands are not active, but greyed out. The following constrai nts apply: • An element can be inserted either into a block or into a channel/test channel and con- verted in the process into a block. • A block can be inserted either into a channel/test channel or into a block and converted in the process into an element. • A subsystem can be inserted only into a safety function. If one or more objects of the same type are already present, the inserted object is appended by default to the last object of this type in the list. Only if drag and drop is used for copying (see Sect ion 7.8.3 ) can the insertion point within a list be specified (by means of the mouse pointer). 7.8.1 Copying",

This can be achieved in three different ways, as described in Section 11.3: • Select an object and use the commands \"Move One Up/Down\" (context menu, button, keyboard shortcut). • Move the objects by means of drag and drop: the object to be sorted is placed above or below another object when dropped upon it, depending upon the latter's position in the list. • Use the commands \"Sort A -Z\" or \"Sort Z -A\" to resort the object list. 7.9 Addin g content to copied objects When an object has been copied into a project, information must often be added in order to permit proper analysis of the object or safety function. Only the user is able to do this, since he or she is familiar with the control s ystem concerned. Such information is for example the diagnostic coverage (DC), and in the case of components subject to wear, statement of the mean number of operations per year (n op). Even if the SIS -lib is write -protected, this information can still be entered by the user after the object has been copied into the project. It is essential that inadvertent changes to other val - ues in the process be avoided. To enable the new object to be identified in the project, an item designation, possibly an inventory number and further project -specific comments are also often added to the object name or the documentation. 7 Working with SISTEMA libraries SISTEMA Coo",

In contrast to the usual SIS -libs, it is irrelevant whether the VDMA -libs are stored locally or on a network PC. Nor does a database server need to be installed on the network PC. 8.1 Opening VDMA libraries The command for loading VDMA -libs into the VDMA library window is \"Add Library\". This command opens a file manager ( Figure 36) in which the folder and the VDMA -lib can be selected and added to the list of manufacturers and libraries with the \"Open\" button.

Components/parts of control systems can be modelled in objects in several different ways. Possible strategies are described below for the creation of a library. Annex D shows an exam ple of a list in which typical components/parts of control systems are mapped to the object types. SISTEMA is flexible in the modelling of components/parts of control systems in SISTEMA objects. Two essential alternatives exist: 1. The resulting parameters (e.g. PL, SIL, PFH D, MTTF D) of the components/parts of control systems are calculated not in SISTEMA, but by other means. These values can then be entered directly into the suitable SISTEMA objects ( Figure 38, example SB1). This alterna tive is described in Section 10.1.1 . 2. The resulting values are calculated in SISTEMA from a number of defined sub- objects (Figure 38, example SB2).

Manufacturers' SIS -libs are generally write- protected for this reason. 11 Creation of SISTEMA libraries SISTEMA Coo kbook 5 (Version 2.0) 67 / 85 The procedure is as follows: create a duplicate of the SIS -lib (a second SLB file) and save it with a different name and file name. Write- protection of this dupl icate is activated by SISTEMA. The result is therefore the original library, which is not write- protected, and its write -protected copy. The write- protection is implemented by attributes in the database and can be detected only by SISTEMA itself. SISTEMA i ndicates the write- protection status by a padlock symbol ( Figure 50).

The objects can however be copied into SISTEMA projects or into other non -write - protected SIS -libs and modified there. Figure 50: Padlock symbol indicating write- protection of SIS -libs Write -protection has repercussions for the use of libraries created with older versions of SISTEMA. A write -protected library can be updated by reading- in of the non- write -protected original SIS -lib, which is then saved and write- protected following a (pseudo- )change.

The advantage of this alternative is that documents do not need to be saved locally. Access to the documents is nevertheless possible at any time, even once the library objects have been copied to a pro ject and the project has been passed on to fur - ther users, customers or suppliers. • Relative path: the manufacturers' documents must be saved locally together with the SIS-lib.

This generally ensures that the documents retrieved from the object of a library can actually be opened. The opening of rela - tive paths does not currently work in network libraries (Version 2.0 ): in this case, documents must be located and opened manually, or copied into a project. At present (Version 2.0 ), documents are not automaticall y copied into a project along with the objects to which they relate. Users must therefore copy the documents themselves (see Section 7.6). It is generally sufficien t to copy the document folder of the library into the pro - ject folder (by default, into the \". \\documents\" folder). 11.8 Version control and compatibility SISTEMA projects and libraries bear a three- digit version number. The number is taken from the version of SISTEMA with which they were created or modified. Example: SISTEMA Ver - sion 1.1.6 was published in mid- 2013. Projects and libraries created or modified with this version also receive the version number 1.1.6. The significance of the three digits is as follows: • The leading digit indicates major changes to the program concept and at the same time to the database structure. • The middle digit generally changes when changes are made to the database structure. Program functionality may have been extended. • The final digit is used for bug fixes and extended functionality; the database structure has not changed in this case. 11 Creation of SISTEMA libraries SISTEMA Coo kbook 5 (Version 2.0) 70 / 85 Downward compatibility of libraries is assured only if the database structure has remained unchanged.

If this loaded SIS-lib is modified and saved, the version number of the library changes to that of the SISTEMA version used (in this case, Version 1.1.2). Section 7.5 describes the ramifications of the different cases of version differences when libraries are opened. Upward compatibility is also assured when the database structure is extended: older ver - sions of a SIS -lib are also loaded correctly by the current SISTEMA version, and in general no mes sage is displayed. This is the case even where the database structures differ; in this case, the extended data fields of the newer version are added and populated with intelligent content (generally empty fields). Saving causes the version number of the li brary to be updated to that of the newer database. If a SIS -lib, for example of a manufacturer, is write- protected, the version number cannot be changed. The SIS -lib can nevertheless be used and read. Manufacturers wishing to create a SIS -lib are advised always to use the most recent version of SISTEMA. This makes the latest functions and bug fixes available. The SIS -libs created by the newer version can be used by older SISTEMA versions, provided they share the same database structure. Another strategy is to create the SIS -lib using a recent version, but then to open it with an older version of SISTEMA (with up to two version numbers' difference) and to save it again. This assigns the older version number to the SIS -lib, making it downward compatible without warning messages.

Other conventions are possible; the IFA does not formu- late binding rules in this respect. The choice of name must however consider requirements such as ease of comprehension, freedom from contradictions, etc., in order to pr event users from using an incorrect SIS -lib or objects from it for a project. Many manufacturers and users will typically create multiple SIS -libs, as a function of the total number of their products/objects. Larger numbers of products/objects (over approx . 200) should be divided intelligently between several SIS -libs, in order to limit the size of the indi - vidual SIS -libs and therefore the time required to load them.

In this case, the manufacturer will create only one SIS -lib per language and version. The product group can otherwise be geared to the manufacturer's preferences and product range.

The separate VDMA library window (Chapter 5) is used for this purpose from SISTEMA Version 2 onwards.

The \"Import...\" command causes all content from the XML file to be added to the library currently loaded. Existing library entries are retained. The \"Export...\" command saves the entire library to an XML file. This facilitates the compilation of libraries. The content of such an XML file can of course also be edited or created manually. Note in this case that the relational table structure of the SQL database is modelled by the XML structure. This also enables very large libraries to be divided into several small libraries. SISTEMA checks the validity of the XML file (SSM projects and XML imports) against a rudimentary XML schema. This schema has the file name ssm.xsd and can be found in the SISTEMA program folder.

To begin with, you can create libraries directly in SISTEMA: create a new library, enter the data for each product, then write -protect the library (see Chapters 10 and 11). Examples are already available from many other manufacturers who are publishing SIS -libs. Besides the parameters, you can also attach documents and internet links to your online documents directly to the library. Should you wish to export your data from a database automatically in the form of a SIS -lib, please request the database documentation from us with which you can develop an export tool (Chapter 12). This is generally worthwhile only for very large volumes of data, or when the library data are subject to frequent change. Besides the organizational requirements for creating the SIS -lib, certain technical require- ments must also be met. These include: • Knowledge of the EN ISO 13849 -1 and - 2 control standards • Availability of the required product parameters • Experience in the use of SISTEMA Creation of manufacturers' libraries for the first time often raises the following questions (Q), more comprehensive answers (A) to which can be found in the various sections of",

Any other use or exploitation, particularly modification, is subject to prior approval by the IFA (such as the importing and conv erting of SISTEMA libraries or the importing and exporting of SISTEMA project files). Any party using the SISTEMA technology to create SISTEMA libraries must state when making the libraries public, and particularly when providing public access to them on the Internet, that the libraries have been tested by the creator only for SISTEMA and may therefore be used only by SISTEMA. Use of SISTEMA : The legal information for the installed SISTEMA version and documenta- tion apply. This information is displayed on the download page for SISTEMA, during the installation process, and subsequently in the SISTEMA readme file (which can be found in the installation folder). Exclusion of liability The software was developed with care and in line with current good scientific and industrial practice. It is made available to the user free of charge. The liability of the IFA/DGUV is thus limited to wrongful",

No guarantee can however be given that the software and information provided are virus -free. Users are there fore advised to take appropriate precautions of their own and to scan for viruses before downloading software, documentation or information. Licensing information SISTEMA is free software and may be copied and distributed freely. Modification of SISTEMA is not permitted. Please note however that SISTEMA makes use of further open - source software the use of which is covered by licenses of its own. Modified versions of these software components may be distributed only under the terms of the respective licences . The source code covered by the respective licences has been adopted without modification. The \"ZeosLib\" library and the source code of the version used are also supplied with SISTEMA (refer to the \"Standards/ZeosLib\" sub- folder).

This document describes a universal database in XML format serving as a common basis for the exchange of param eters and information between machine manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, test bodies and suppliers of analysis tools in the area of functional safety. Representatives of manufacturers and users of safety -related control components and the IFA were inv olved in development of this VDMA Specification . Further information (in German) and a list of manufacturers can be found on the VDMA web-site ( www.vdma.org) under the search term \"Ein heitsblatt 66413\". In Version 2, the IFA has extended the SISTEMA application with the addition of an import interface for this universal database format. The interface is implemented as a new SISTEMA window. It enables an XML file to be opened in the window and a device to be selected w ith a set of values in the desired language. For further development of new data fields of the universal database, the existing SISTEMA database, the SISTEMA libraries and the input dialogs have been extended. The SISTEMA libraries for users and manufacturers will continue to be supported and the functionality of the SISTEMA library window to be developed further. A tool for the conversion of SISTEMA libraries to a corresponding XML file and an editor for the creation of XML files are not planned, however. Analysis of the XML data to EN 62061 is not implemented. 14 Annexes SISTEMA Coo kbook 5 (Version 2.0) 83 / 85 Annex C Index of abbreviations/equation symbols Type of",

Machine operators expect to be offered only s afe machinery or devices. This expectation exists worldwide. There are also regulations on the protection of operators of machinery worldwide. Such regulations are different depending on countries and regions. However, there is broad agreement on the process to be applied during the manufacture and upgrade of machinery: During the design and manufacture of machinery, the machine manufacturer shall identify and evaluate all possible hazards and hazardous points by undertaking a risk assessment. Based on this risk assessment, the machine manufacturer shall take suitable design measures to eliminate or reduce the risk. If the risk cannot be eliminated by these design measures or the remaining risk is not tolerable, the machine manufacturer shall select and apply suitable protective devices, and provide information on the residual risks if necessary. To ensure the intended measures work correctly, overall validation is necessary. This overall validation shall evaluate the design and technical measures, as well as the organizational measures in context. About this guide What does the guide contain?

Two additional chapters describe the regulatory requirements for the machine manufacturer and the requirements for the machine user. This guide describes the legal requirements on the safety of machinery in the European Union and their implementation. The legal requirements relating to machinery in other regions (e.g., North America, Asia) are described in separate versions of this guide. It is not possible to derive any claims whatsoever from the following information, irrespective of the legal basis, as every machine requires a specific solution against the background of national and international regula‐ tions and standards. We refer to the latest published standards and direc‐ tives at the time of publishing. If, in the event of new standards, the use of the predecessor standard is per‐ mitted for a transition period, we have noted this situa‐ tion in the relevant chapters of this guide.

Use of the terms “safety” and “safe” in this document Ac cording to ISO Guide 51, \"The term “safe” is often understood by the general public as the state of being protected from all hazards. However, this is a misunderstanding: “safe” is rather the state of being protected from recognized hazards that are likely to cause harm”. Some level of risk is inherent in all products or systems (so-called residual risk). Absolute certainty is therefore not possible. In this guide, the terms “safety” and “safe” are used as qualifiers for better understanding and readability. The terms are defined, as in ISO Guide 51, as “freedom from unacceptable risks” and are not to be understood as absolute protection against hazards. SICK assumes no liability for the interpretation of the terms “safe” and “safety” in this document.FOREWORD 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK S P E C I A L I N F O R M A T I O N | Guide for Safe Machinery 7 Subject to change without notice Your editorial team Figure 3: From left to right: Otto Görnemann, Rolf Schumacher, Stephanie Kaiser, Hans-Jörg Stubenrauch, Matthias Kurrus, Har ald Schmidt. Machine safeguarding in the work process The requirements on the safeguarding of machinery have changed more and more with the increasing use of automa tion. In the past, protective devices in the manufacturing process were something of a nuisance; for this reason, they were often not used at all. Today, innovative technologies make it easy to integrate protective devices into the manufacturing process. As a result, they are no longer a hindrance for the operator and even help productivity in many cases. For this reason, reliable protective devices that are integrated into the manufacturing process",

Studies show that people continuously subjected to stressful situations are more suscept ible t o psychosomatic illnesses. Even though it is possible to adapt to extreme situations over the long term, they will place a great strain on the individual. It is often said, however, that more “safety” results in lower productivity – the opposite is actually the case: Higher levels of safety result in increased motivation and satisfaction and, as a result, higher productivity. The following requirement on the machine manufacturer and user can be derived from this: Operators and maintenance personnel shall be able to rely on the safety of a machine! Safety is a management task Employers in industry are responsible for their employees as well as for smooth, cost-effective production. Only if mana g ers make safety part of everyday business activities will employees be receptive to the subject. To improve sustainability, experts are therefore calling for the establishment of a wide-ranging “safety culture” in the respective companies. Involvement of the employees results in acceptance It is extremely important that the needs of operators and maintenance personnel are taken into consideration in the plannin g at concept level. Only an intelligent safety concept matched to the work process and the personnel will result in the required acceptance.FOREWORD 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK S P E C I A L I N F O R M A T I O N | Guide for Safe Machinery 9 Subject to change without notice Expert knowledge is required In",

A further goal is the creation of a single market with free movement of goods. In order to achieve such goals, the functioning of the European Union is regulated by treaty as follows: The EU Commission or the Council of the European Union issues legal acts, including so-called directives, which define the basic objectives and requirements. The directives are kept technology-neutral as far as possible. The Member States then have to implement these directives in their national legislation. The following directives have been published in the area of health and safety at work and machine safety: • The Machinery Directive, which addresses the manufacturers of machines • The Work Equipment Directive, which addresses the users of machines • Additional directives, e.g., Low Voltage Directive, EMC Directive, ATEX Directive The application of harmonized standards provides presumption of conformity with the directives.

A partly completed machine is only intended to be installed in other machinery or in other partly completed machinery or equipment, or to be combined with such machinery or equipment in order to form a machine in the context of the Directive. Partly completed machinery cannot meet all requirements of the Machinery Directive.

These documents exist as CLC/TS or as CEN/TS. • A document that also has “TR” as a prefix is a report on the state of the art. A harmonized European standard is prepared as follows: 1. T he EU Commission, as the executive organ of the EU, issues a mandate to CEN or CENELEC to draft a European standard to specify in detail the requirements of a directive. 2.

A risk assessment is a sequence of logical steps that facilitate the systematic analysis and evaluation of risks. The results of the risk assessment must be taken into account when designing and constructing the machine (risk reduction). The risk assessment should help to reduce or avoid risks. As a consequence it may identify necessary measures to protect the operator from hazards. If necessary, the risk assessment process must be repeated several times. The first process steps are intended to identify and assess hazards. This is followed by an evaluation and, if necessary, risk mitigation. If the measure triggers a new hazard, the repeated risk assessment reveals this. Being machine-related and application-specific, the risk assessment is already specified in many type-C standards.

This iterative process must take into account all hazards and risks until there are no residual risks or only acceptable residual risks remain. Risk assessment process • St art the risk assessment by establishing the functions and the limits of the machine. • During the risk assessment, take into account in particular reasonably foreseeable misuse and malfunctions. • Then identify the hazards (mechanical, electrical, thermal,etc.) derived from the operation of the machine. Take into account these hazards in all life phases of the machine. • Then estimate the risks derived from the hazards. These depend on the extent of harm and the probability of occurrence of the harm. • Document the results of your risk assessment.1 – RISK ASSESSMENT 28 S P E C I A L I N F O R M A T I O N | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice Risk reduction strategy If the risk assessment shows that measures are required to reduce the risk, the 3-step method shall be used.

During this process, possible haz ards are excluded by design. Safe design is therefore the most effective approach. Aspects of safe design relate to the machine itself and the interaction between the person at risk and the machine. Examples: • Mechanical design • Operating and maintenance concept • Electrical equipment (electrical safety, EMC) • Strategies for emergency stop in an emergency situation • Equipment involving fluids • Materials and resources used • Machine function and production process All components should be selected, applied and adapted in such a way that the safety of persons is maintained in the event of a machine error. The prevention of harm to the machine and the environment shall also be considered. All elements of the machine shall be designed to operate within the specified limits. The design should be as simple as possible. Safety-related functions shall be separated from other functions as far as possible.

Depending on the wire cross-section laid, PE and N conductors are laid as a common conductor (TN-C system) or as two independent conductors (TN-S system). TT system In a T T s ystem, the star point of the supply transformer is earthed in the same way as in a TN system. The protective conductor connected to the electrically conductive equipment housing is not connected to this star point, but is earthed separately. The chassis of the equipment can also be earthed using a common protective earth electrode. TT systems are usually only used in connection with residual current circuit breakers. The advantage of the TT system lies in its increased reliability for remote areas. IT system The conduc tive housings of the equipment in an IT system are earthed in the same way as in a TT system, but the star point of the feeding transformer is not.

All these protective devices implement safety functions, but not every protective device has to be integrated into the machine controller for this purpose. Fixed physical guards (fences, barriers, covers), for example, are not integrated into the machine controller but if designed correctly, such guards fulfill the requirement of the safety function. Functional safety When pr otective devices are integrated into the machine controller, the risk reduction relies on the correct functioning of the controller. In this case, we refer to this as functional safety. When implementing functional safety, the required safety level must be determined for each safety function. The requirements of each particular protective measure must be implemented using suitable components. Validation The v alidation of all technical protective measures ensures that the safety functions reliably reduce the risk.

Fault masking can occur when switches with volt-free contacts are connected in series. Since the evaluation unit only evaluates the signals of the complete series, fault detection can be prevented.

This may lead to the performance level being reduced to PL d or PL c. NOTE For mor e information, see the special information “ Safe series connection ” from SICK. Electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) With electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE), in contrast to “guards”, protection is not based on the physical separ a tion of persons at risk from the hazard itself. Protection is achieved through temporal separation. As long as there is somebody in a defined area, no dangerous machine functions are initiated, and such functions are stopped if already underway. A certain amount of time, referred to as the “stopping/run-down time”, is required to stop these functions. The ESPE must detect the approach of a person to the hazardous area in a timely manner and depending on the application, the presence of the person in the hazardous area. The international standard IEC 61496-1 defines safety-related requirements for ESPE independent of their tech‐ nology or principle of operation. What are the benefits of electro-sensitive protective equipment? If an oper a tor frequently or regularly has to access a machine and is therefore exposed to a hazard, the use of an ESPE instead of (mechanical) physical guards (covers, safety fencing, etc.) is advantageous thanks to: • Reduced access time (operator does not have to wait for the guard to open) • Increased productivity (time savings when loading the machine) • Improved workplace ergonomics (operator does not have to operate a physical guard) In addition, operators and others alike are protected.

AOPDs with a detection capability of more than 40 mm are called safety multibeam sensors. They are used to protect access to hazardous areas ( see figure 44, page 70 ). AOPDs with a detection capability of 40 mm or less are called safety light curtains and are used to safeguard hazardous points directly ( see figure 45 ). With both safety multibeam sensors and safety light curtains, rather than all light beams being activated at the same time, they are usually activated and deac‐ tivated in rapid sequence one after the other.

These signals from the OSSDs are used to stop the dangerous machine functions. A safety laser scanner is an optical sensor which monitors a hazardous area on a machine or vehicle by scanning the area around it on a single plane with infrared light beams. The safety laser scanner operates on the principle of optic al time-of-flight measurement. The scanner sends very short light pulses (S) while an “electronic stop‐ watch” runs simultaneously. If the light strikes an object, it is reflected and received by the scanner (R). The scanner calculates the distance from the object from the difference between the send and receive times. A uniformly rotating mirror (M) in the scanner deflects the light pulses such that a sector of a circle is covered. The scanner then determines the exact position of the object from the measured distance and the angle of rotation of the mirror.

This ensures that an object of this size always covers a light beam and is always detected regardless of its position in the protective field. For safety laser scanners (AOPDDR), the detection capability is dependent of the distance to the object, the angle between the individual beams of light (pulse), and the shape and size of the transmitted beam. The reliability of the detection capability is determined by the type classification in the IEC 61496 series of standards ( see table 28, page 75 ). Preventing reflections from AOPDs For AOPDs, the light beam is focused from the sender. The aper ture angle of the lens is reduced as far as possible so that disturbance-free operation can even be ensured in the event of minor alignment errors. The same applies to the aperture angle of the receiver (effective aperture angle according to IEC 61496-2). But even for smaller aperture angles, there is the possi‐ bility for light beams from the sender to be deflected from reflective surfaces, thus leading to a failure to detect an object ( see figure 49 , see figure 50 ). Therefore, all reflective surfaces and objects (e.g. mate‐ rial containers, reflective floors) have to maintain a min‐ imum distance a from the protective field of the system (see table 28, page 75 ). This minimum distance a depends on the distance D between the sender and receiver (protective field width). The minimum distance must be maintained on all sides of the protective field.

There is a danger that the affected AOPD will lose its ability to provide protection (see figure 51 ). Assembly situations of this kind must be avoided. If this is not possible, suitable measures must be taken to prevent mutual interference (assembly of opaque partitions or reversing the direction of transmission of a system, for example). Type 4 AOPDs either have to have suitable external sender detection and change to a safe state (outputs in OFF state) when affected or have technical means to prevent interference.

Figure 60: Entry/exit function with horizontally installed safety lig ht curtain in a processing station on an automobile assem‐ bly line Safety laser scanner with protective field switching Another way of moving material into a protected area is to ac tively switch protective fields. As an alternative to active protective field switching, it is possible to sep‐ arately evaluate simultaneous protective fields. Safety laser scanners with vertical (or slightly tilted) protective fields are generally used for this application. The appropriate protective field, from a series of pre‐ programmed protective fields, is activated by corre‐ sponding signals from the machine controller and ade‐ quately positioned sensors. The contour of the protec‐ tive field is designed such that passage of the material does not cause the protective device to activate, but unmonitored areas are small enough to prevent unde‐ tected entry into the hazardous area by anyone ( see figure 61). Alternatively, protective field switching can be per‐ formed independently by the protective device without the need for external sensors or signals (e.g., the Safe Portal system solution from SICK, see figure 58, page 78 ).

Blanking can be used to allow specific objects through the protective field, e.g., hose for cooling lubricant, slide/carrier for workpieces ( see figure 62). For fixed blanking , the blanked area is precisely defined in terms of its size and position. For floating blanking , only the size of the blanked area is defined, not its position in the protective field (see table 30). If the object for which the blanking function in the pro‐ tective field had been configured, is no longer present in the protective field, there will be a gap in the protec‐ tive field of the AOPD. In this case, the AOPD can trigger the safety function (off state). This prevents undetected approach of parts of the human body to the hazard zone. If the blanked area is not completely covered by the blanked objects, a gap(s) is created in the protective field. This/these must be closed by additional coverage (see figure 62 ). Alternatively, the detection capability resulting from the gap must be taken into account in the minimum distance calculation.

Conforming to the standards, PSDI mode can only be executed with type 4 AOPDs and an effective resolution d ≤ 30 mm. In PSDI mode, the machine waits at a defined position for a specified number of interruptions by the operator.

Single break PSDI mode means that the AOPD initiates the machine function after the operator has completed one intervention. Double break PSDI mode means that the AOPD holds the machine function in the locked state after the operator's first intervention (e.g., removal of a machined workpiece). Only after the operator has completed the second intervention (e.g., feeding in of a blank) does the safety light curtain release the machine function again. PSDI mode is often used on presses and stamps, but can also be used on other machines (e.g., rotating tables, automatic assembly systems).

The minimum dist ance corresponds to the braking distance of the vehicle. An exact calculation of the braking distance is not possible, as it depends on several factors, e.g., friction between the tire and ground, total weight incl. load, braking force, etc. It is therefore recommended to first calculate the minimum distance and validate (confirm) the result by testing.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION 98 S P E C I A L I N F O R M A T I O N | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice For the calculation, the braking deceleration of the vehicle (a) at nominal load, maximum operating speed (v 0) and under t he int ended operating conditions must be known or determined.

On press brakes, small pieces of plate must be held very close to the bending edge. Moving systems that form a protective field around the tool openings have proven to be practical protective devices. Because the hand approach speed of the operator is not taken into account in such applications, the general formula is not applicable. The requirements to be met by the resolution are very high and reflections on metal surfaces shall be prevented. For this reason, focused laser systems with image-based evaluation are used. This type of protection is defined in the type-C standards in conjunction with other measures (e.g., 3-pedal foot switch, automatic stop time measure‐ ment, requirement to wear gloves, etc.). NOTE - Saf ety of press brakes: EN 12622 (type-C standard) NOTE Specif ic k now-how and equipment are required to measure the stopping/run-down time and the required minimum distance. SICK offers these measurements as a service. Approaches to calculating the minimum distance Solution approach 1: Perpendicular approach – hazardous point protection with presence detection The c alculation results in a minimum distance of S = 320 mm ( see figure 83 ). By using a safety light curtain with the best possible resolution (14 mm), this is already the optimal minimum distance. Two AOPDs are used to ensure that the person is detected everywhere in the hazardous area: • a vertical AOPD positioned according to the calculated minimum distance (vertical approach) - for the safety function: initiating a stop • a horizontal AOPD to eliminate the risk of standing behind - for the safety function: preventing an unexpected start-up3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION 100 S P E C I A L I",

The reset must be performed using a special operated device.

They generally also have automatic monitoring func tions. The cut-off paths can be set up based on contact or using semiconductors. They can also have signaling contacts. Building more complex safety applications is simplified by integrating multiple functions into one device. The certified safety relay also reduces the time and effort involved in validating the safety functions. In safety relays, semiconductor elements can perform the task of the electromechanical switching elements instead of relays. Using measures to detect faults such as the sampling of dynamic signals or measures to control faults such as multiple channel signal processing, purely electronic control systems can achieve the necessary degree of reliability. Logic unit with software-based components Similar t o automation technology, safety technology has developed from hard-wired auxiliary contactors through safety relays (some with configurable safety logic for which parameters can be set) to complex fail-safe PLCs. The concept of “proven components” and “proven safety principles” must be transferred to electrical and programma‐ ble electronic systems. The logical operators for the safety function are implemented in the software. Software is to be differentiated from firmware — developed and certified by the manufacturer of the control device — and the actual safety application, which is developed by the machine manufacturer using the functionality supported by the firmware.

One or more contactors can form a safety function subsystem by combining special selection criteria, wiring, and technical measures. By protecting the contacts against overcurrent and short-circuits, over-sizing (normally by a factor of 2) and other measures, a contactor is considered a proven component. To be able to perform diagnostics on contactors for safety functions, unambiguous feedback of the output state is necessary (EDM = external device monitoring). This requirement can be met using a contactor with positively guided contacts. The contacts are positively guided when the contacts in a set of contacts are mechanically linked in such a way that normally open contacts and normally closed contacts can never be closed simultaneously during at any point during the intended mission time.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION 118 S P E C I A L I N F O R M A T I O N | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice The term “positively guided contacts” refers primarily to au xiliary contactors and auxiliary contacts.

Since on contactors with low switching capacity (< 4 kW) there is essentially no difference between the main contact elements and the auxiliary contact elements, it is also possible to use the term “positively guided contacts” to refer to those small contactors. On larger contactors, what are known as “mirror con‐ tacts” are used: While a main contact on a contactor is closed, no mirror contact (auxiliary normally closed contact) is allowed to be closed.

Servo amplifiers and frequency inverters In dr i ve technology, three-phase motors with frequency inverters have largely replaced DC drives. The inverter generates an output voltage of variable frequency and amplitude from the fixed three-phase mains. Depending on design, regulated rectifiers can feed the energy absorbed by the intermediate circuit during braking back to the mains. The rectifier converts the electrical power supplied from the mains and feeds it to the DC intermediate circuit.

    "text": "To monit or the drive, external monitoring units require various signals providing information about the current movement parameters. In this case the signal sources are sensors and encoders. These must either be designed as safe sensors or with redundancy, depending on the required safety level PL or SIL. Alternatively, standstill monitoring can also be implemented by reading back the voltage induced by the motor coasting down. This technique also functions with speed-controlled drives. Safety sub-functions integrated in the drive Saf ety functions are implemented by safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS). They include the sub-func‐ tions of measuring (sensor), processing (logic unit), and switching or actuation (power control element). In this context, safety-related functions integrated in the drive are to be considered safety sub-functions. They are generally divided into two groups: • Safety-related stopping and braking functions: These functions are used to stop the drive safely (e.g., safe stop). • Safe monitoring functions: These functions are used for the safe monitoring of the drive during operation (e.g., safely reduced speed). In general, the drive monitoring functions necessary depend on the application. Boundary conditions include parameters such as the necessary braking distance, the presence of kinetic energy, etc. The shutdown response varies depending on the selected safety sub-function. For example, on a stop request, safe torque off (STO) results in uncontrolled coasting down of the movement. During a safe stop (SS1 or SS2), controlled retardation is initiated. A combination of element functions may also need to be implemented as a suitable measure. Possible interfaces for the implementation of safety sub-functions integrated directly in the drive are: • Discrete 24-V signals • Control communication (channel 1)/24 V discrete (channel 2) • Safe communication systems (field-bus systems/network interface) In control communication, a setpoint for speed or position is transmitted from the standard controller",

    "text": "generally leads to malfunctions. A general rule for all valves is that contamination leads to premature wear, thus negating the essential prerequisites used for design and dimensioning based on a defined probability of failure. The mechanical springs for the reset function used in monostable valves are generally designed for high endur‐ ance and can be considered proven in accordance with ISO 13849-2. However, exclusion of failure in the event of the springs breaking is not possible. An important differentiating factor between the valves is the design of the moving switching element inside the valve. The failure mode for each valve is essentially determined by its design. Poppet valves might leak, but in piston valves, the piston slide might jam. With a poppet valve, the switching function is effected by the moving switching element (valve plate), which changes position relative to a seat inside the housing. This design enables large cross-sections to be released with short strokes. The risk of leaks can be excluded with an appropriate design. In the case of piston valves, the valve body closes or opens the flow path by moving over a bore or circumferential groove. The changes in the cross-section of the piston slide relative to the changes in cross-section inside the housing affect volume flow and are known as control edges. An essential feature of this valve design worthy of note is what is known as the lap. The lap is the longitudinal distance between the stationary and moving control edges of the slide valve. Due to the gap between the piston and the housing bore required for hard-sealing valves, a leak will occur in the event of a pressure differential. Safety-related design principles For t he safety-related use of valves, feedback of the valve position may be necessary. Here various techniques are used:",

Summary: Designing the safety function General • De velop a concept for the required safety functions. In this concept, consider the characteristics of the machine, design, surroundings, protective device, and also take into account human characteristics. • Design appropriate safety functions for the required safety level. Safety functions comprise sensor, logic, and power control element subsystems. • Determine the safety level of each subsystem based on safety aspects (structure, reliability, diagnostics, resistance, process conditions). Properties and application of protective devices • De termine the necessary properties for your protective device. Do you need, for example, one or more elec‐ tro-sensitive protective devices (ESPE), physical guards, movable physical guards or position fixing protective devices? • Determine the correct positioning and dimensions for each protective device, in particular the safety distance (minimum distance) and the necessary protective field size/height for the protective device concerned. • Integrate the protective devices as stated in the instruction handbook and as necessary for the level of safety. Logic units • Choose a suit able lo gic unit based on the number of safety functions and the logic depth. • Use",

From the point of view of ISO 13849-1, only dangerous failures need to be considered (hence the “D” for “dangerous” in MTTF D). This value represents a theoretical parameter expressing the probability of a dangerous failure of a component (not the entire subsystem) within the lifetime of that component. The actual lifetime of the subsystem is always shorter. The MTTF value can be derived from the failure rates.

Summary: Verifying the safety function General • Ver ify that the intended safety functions conform to the required safety level. To do this, verify mechanical and functional safety. Methods • De termine the resulting level of safety as per ISO 13849-1 (PL). Available methods: °Simplified method (based on PL) °Detailed method (based on PFH D values) • If neither the PL nor the PFH D value of the subsystem (e.g., the power control element) is known, determine the safety level of the subsystem from the following aspects: “structure, reliability, diagnostics, resistance, and process”. • Alternatively, determine the resulting level of safety as per IEC 62061 (SIL). Here too it is possible to determine even the safety level of a subsystem that is not certified.

Validation shall show that safety-related parts of the control function meet the requirements of ISO 13849-2, in particular the requirements for the level of safety defined. Insofar as is reasonable, validation should be carried out by persons who were not involved in the design of the safety-related parts of the control systems. In the validation process, it is important to check errors and in particular omissions in the formulated specification. The critical part of how a safety-related control function has been designed is usually the specification. For example, access to a robot cell is to be safeguarded by a light curtain.

The overall assess‐ ment always starts with defining the limits of the machine (usage limits and spatial limits). The limits also include communication interfaces relevant to cybersecurity, both between humans and machines, between machines and the control system, and between machines. A risk assessment or hazard assessment is performed based on these limits. Based on the risk analysis, all sources of danger are analyzed and appropriate measures taken. Cybersecurity attacks do not create new hazards in terms of machine safety, but the effectiveness of protective measures can be negatively impacted or interrupted. For example, the system components associated with a safety requirement might not stop or speeds might not be reduced to the necessary level, creating hazards. Cybersecurity considerations are relevant to the following machines: • Machines with programmable controllers with electronic interfaces • Machines with programmable controllers with a network connection Machines with contact-based controls or machines with electronic but non-programmable controllers are not directly relevant to cybersecurity considerations. If electronically parameterizable components are integrated, hazards can in turn arise via the interface to the parameterization device. What measures are necessary to address the cybersecurity aspects of machine safety? Protective measures familiar from office communications or in the private sphere (firewall, virus scanner) are not suff icient for the industrial environment. A systematic approach is necessary. In general, the following applies to all participants operating in the value chain • the corporate culture and thus awareness within the company of the issue of cybersecurity must be suffi‐ ciently developed. • an appropriate safety management system must be installed. • the relevant knowledge must be up to date. • the necessary technologies with an appropriate level of IT security must be available.3F – FUNCTIONAL SAFETY AND CYBERSECURITY",

    "text": "taken into account as early as when purchasing a machine. How should machinery be purchased? The procurement process is crucial to the success of a project to build or modernize a production facility. The follo wing points, for example, should be considered: • For complex assemblies of machines, designate a “site manager” in accordance with the Machinery Directive. • Clarify the procedure for the machinery or machine components provided in advance. • Draw up a contract specifying how additional documentation is to be provided (e.g., risk assessment, etc.) so that it will be easier to make changes downstream. • Define, as far as possible, the usage of important standards (harmonized standards in the EU) as the basis. • Agree on a procedure in the event of deviations from harmonized standards. Safety inspections Experience shows that in practice, machine safety is not perfect. Protective devices are often manipulated by the machine oper ator in order to work without hindrance. Other problems are the incorrect positioning of protective devices and improper integration into control systems. The safety state of work equipment and systems in operation is regulated by EU Directive 2009/104 / EC (“Work Equipment Directive”); it shall be inspected to ensure conformance with applicable national legislation. In particular, Article 4a of the Directive defines the inspection of work equipment. Technical rules, standards or certain regulations can serve as a guide as to how the inspection should be carried out. The user of the respective equipment must perform a risk assessment and is responsible for ensuring that the inspection is carried out and that occupational safety is ensured. In so doing, the user shall ensure that work equipment is inspected in accordance with the national transposition of the Work Equipment Directive to the country of use.

Significant modification of machinery Machines usually have a service life of several decades. The further development of technologies and the req uirements of the market lead to a continuous improvement of machines and production systems. In many cases, machines are also modified to fit existing production lines and systems. Such modifications may include features and functions that can have a significant impact on the safety of the machine or production line. National regulations may impose specific requirements on the modification of existing machinery, while others are limited to general mandatory clauses for the user (employer). The European Machinery Directive also requires that significantly modified machinery comply with the essential health and safety requirements. The Machinery Directive does not clarify, however, what is to be considered a significant modification. The national European occupational health and safety authorities are given the freedom to define the criteria for a significant modifica‐ tion. The following methodology was developed jointly by industry and occupational health and safety authorities in Germany and has been in use since 2010.

The Machinery Regulation specifies a 42-month transition period and the change from Directive to Regulation will take place on the effective date of January 20, 2027. All machinery placed on the market or put into service before January 20, 2027 must be still CE marked in accordance with the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. From January 20, 2027, the CE marking of machinery or assessment of partly completed machinery will be mandatory under the Machinery Regulation EU 2023/1230. www.tuv.com ® TÜV, TUEV and TUV are registered trademarks. Utilisation and application requires prior approval.. DE23_S01__2300494WHAT IS NEW? Many requirements of the Machinery Regulation are only described in more detail and more clearly. But there are also some changes in content compared to the Machinery Directive of 2006. The requirements for functional safety have been expanded (e.g., software). In addition, there are also the aspects of cyber security and artificial intelligence. Safety requirements for autonomous (mobile) machines have been added. The obligations of the economic operators (manufacturer, authorized representative, importer and distributor) are described in Chapter II of the regulation. Those are presen ted very clearly for the individual economic operators in separate articles. Annex I of the regulation lists the machines for which a special conformity assessment procedure is prescribed. This list is now divided into: ·Part A (obligatory involvement of a notified body) and a ·Part B (procedure as for 2006/42/EC, Annex IV machinery). The diagram shows the possible conformity assessment procedures for the various categories of machinery.

In terms of content, nothing relevant has changed in the procedures „Internal production control“, „EC type examination“ and „Full quality assurance“. The module for „Type based conformity with internal pro - duction control“ is new. This procedure is carried out by the manufacturer on his own responsibility and based on the EC type examination. For complex, customer-specific machines, the module „individual testing“ has been introduced. Here, the Notified Body tests and certifies an individual machine whereupon the serial number of the machine is listed on the certificate. Use the transition period to adapt your machinery and processes in accordance with Regulation EU 2023/1230. At TÜV Rheinland, we will be happy to carry out the testing of your current machinery in accordance with the essential health and safety requirements of Annex III and additionally, we offer you the option of having Annex III of the Machinery Regulation tested already for new machine developments.

Course includes: ■ CE requirements when building and purchasing machines ■ Creating complex assemblies and modifying machinery■ Functional safety■ PUWER assessments Find out more: www.tuv-sud.co.uk/ machinery-safety 5To enable the European Union to trade successfully across boundaries, the European Commission embarked on a policy of harmonisation. Initially the Commission proposed Directives, which would identify a unified approach to the production and trade of products and goods across Europe. However these Directives were prescriptive and it was felt that this was having a detrimental effect on innovation and invention. To counter this the Commission introduced the New Approach Directives (CE marking Directives). These Directives are not prescriptive and lay down minimum criteria for compliance. The New Approach Directives are similar in format for ease of reference and use. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the new legislation is the conformity assessment procedure (the means by which the compliance is ensured). The Directives offer a flexible approach.

The New Approach Directives lay down minimum criteria for compliance. These criteria are called The Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSR). The preferred way to comply with EHSRs is by Risk Assessment and the application of harmonised EN standards, which are replacing the national standards of member states.

Ignorance of the legislation is no excuse and a punitive penalty structure is documented. The requirements under the EMC Directive are: That the product must not interfere with any other product in any way. The product must meet certain standards in that it must not suffer interference from any other product. 1 sectionLegislative Framework 77Low Voltage Directive The Low Voltage Directive states that: Only electrical equipment which does not jeopardise the safety of people, domestic animals and property shall be placed onto the market. Equipment operating at voltage between 50v & 1000v AC and 75v &1500v DC should comply. The requirements under the Low Voltage Directive are: That the product is electrically safe The product has been constructed in accordance with accepted good engineering practice and is safe The product has been designed and constructed in accordance with the Principal Elements of the Safety Objectives of the Directive. Electrical equipment shall be designed and constructed to ensure that it is safe when connected to the electricity supply, by providing a level of protection against electric shock. Pressure Equipment Directive The Pressure Equipment Directive (PED) 97/23/EC which affects equipment operating at a pressure greater than 0.5 bar, entered into force on 29th November 1999 and is mandatory from 29th May 2002.PED is generally considered one of, if not the most complex and difficult to understand of the new approach directives. Many organisations, particularly small and medium sized companies with limited resource to allocate specifically to the task of conformance, are reporting difficulties in interpretation and application.The PED impacts upon design, production, final inspection/test, marking and labelling and instructions for use/maintenance. Therefore, in most affected companies no single person will be able to",

The PED requires that each affected item of pressure equipment be categorised according to specific criteria. If you are not fully conversant with the directive this process can be time consuming and can result in costly errors. The Directive provides many options and routes to conformity (modules), inappropriate choice can lead to significant third party inspection costs. ATEX Directive The “ATEX” Directive 94/9/EC is a so-called “New Approach” Directive which provides the technical requirements to be applied to equipment intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. It is named after the French “ATmosphere EXplosible”. The Directive covers a surprisingly large range of equipment, potentially including equipment used on fixed offshore platforms, in petro-chemical plants, mines, flour mills and other areas where a potentially explosive atmosphere may be present. In very broad terms, there are three pre-conditions for the Directive to apply: The equipment must have its own source of ignition Be intended for use in a potentially explosive atmosphere (air mixtures) Be under normal atmospheric conditions. Legislative Framework 1 section 8The Directive also covers components essential for the safe use and safety devices directly contributing to the safe use of the equipment in scope. These latter devices may be outside the potentially explosive environment. Work Equipment Directive The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER) requires users of work equipment to carry out risk assessment and provide work equipment that is suitable for its intended task and can be used without putting persons at risk. The Regulations cover any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether exclusively or not) - effectively it is anything used at work.

After work equipment has been exposed to any conditions causing deterioration, which is liable to cause a dangerous situation. At suitable intervals; and Each time that exceptional circumstances have occurred that are liable to jeopardise the safety of work equipment. The results of these inspections have to be documented and kept.The regulations make it an offence to allow work equipment to leave an employer’s undertaking, or if obtained from another undertaking, be used, unless it is accompanied by physical evidence that the last inspection has been carried out. EN Standards By definition a standard is “A document established by consensus and approved by a recognised body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context” (ISO/IEC guide 2 (1986). Three organisations are mandated by the European Commission to produce standards, with each organisation being responsible for specific standards. Once a standard has been produced through the process as detailed by CEN and CENELEC they become known as transposed harmonised standards. European member states will then remove any existing national standards which conflict with the new standard and add the relevant country prefix. For example, EN designates that the standard is a full, harmonised standard. The process of transposition adds the country prefix hence a standard will become BS EN in the UK. A DIN EN standard in Germany will be exactly the same. 1 sectionLegislative Framework 9SEMI Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI) is",

The Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Committee within SEMI’s International Standards Division develops industry standards and guidelines that are globally accepted as ensuring the highest level of safety and quality. SEMI standards focus on lowering manufacturing costs, developing new industries and guaranteeing the existence of open markets. SEMI S2 is the foundation guideline in SEMI’s fleet of safety documents which defines the minimum safety requirements for semiconductor products. Conforming to SEMI S2 contributes to business efficiency and profitability whilst increasing the marketability of products. Why Use Standards? The use of standards is not mandatory, however, if a standard is applied correctly, conformance with the relevant EHSRs of a directive may be presumed, hence they represent the surest way to compliance. The user though, must still ensure that the equipment complies with the Directive and is in fact safe. Maritime specifics November 2006 saw a major change with PUWER. Up to this date, work equipment on ships was outside of the scope of PUWER because there were other maritime regulations that took precedence (these have now been revoked). In September 2006, a new maritime version of PUWER was published. The Merchant Shipping & Fishing Vessels (Provision & Use of Work Equipment) Regulations 2006 impose the minimum health and safety requirements for the provision and use of work equipment by workers at work. The regulations require that employers shall ensure that the work equipment made available to workers on board a ship, is suitable for the work being carried out and safe to use. Alongside the maritime PUWER regulations is a maritime version of LOLER (Lifting operations, Lifting Equipment Regulations), which applies LOLER to ships in the same manner that PUWER has now been applied.

They have always been considered machinery due to the latent energy in the hydraulic systems that balance them. At a recent meeting of Notified Bodies for the Machinery Directive, it was discussed whether linkspans should actually fall under Annex IV of the Machinery Directive as they effectively lift people, and devices for the lifting of people are Annex IV machines. The discussion concluded that linkspans should be considered as Annex IV machinery and so maritime architects and builders will now have to use a Notified Body when building linkspans in ports.Legislative Framework 1 section Functional Safety Functional Safety is the part of the overall safety of a system or piece of equipment that depends on the system or equipment operating correctly in response to its inputs, including the safe management of likely operator errors, hardware and software failure and environmental changes. TÜV SÜD provide a broad range of functional safety services from assessments to our industry-recognised ‘Functional Safety Certified Professional’ training course. Find out more: www.tuv-sud.co.uk/ functional-safety 11 Guidance on carrying out risk assessment can be found in many places. EN ISO 12100 is the main standard for risk assessment for machinery as it sets down the principles for the process. Risk assessment is fundamental to any health and safety process and in particular machinery safety. Because of this, anyone involved in dealing with machinery safety issues should be competent in risk assessment and be well aware of the types of hazards that may occur across their working environment. Risk Assessment is subjective therefore the information in this section gives help and advice on risk assessment. It has to be stressed that it is only a guide and the onus remains firmly with the person",

A risk is: The likelihood of someone coming into contact with a hazard and the degree of injury or damage to health that could be caused should contact occur. A hazardous situation is: A situation where people are exposed to hazards. Examples: A moving belt on a conveyor would be a hazard.

An electrical enclosure containing voltages above 50v AC and 75v DC that has uncovered terminations is a hazard even though the enclosure may be kept locked and strict key control enforced. The reason for this is that if an electrician had to carry out diagnostic testing on a live enclosure they could inadvertently touch an adjacent terminal with a tool etc. The risk would be the likelihood of that happening and the severity of injury or damage to health that could be caused. Risk Assessment Definition A comprehensive estimation of the probability and degree of possible injury or damage to health in a hazardous situation in order to select appropriate safety measures. Risk Assessment Objective To achieve adequate safety according to the state of the art and technical and economic requirements. There are numerous ways of assessing risk involved with a hazard, one of which is the hazard rating number system (HRN). The risk assessment method that is used by TÜV SÜD is Preliminary Hazard Analysis, which uses the HRN system. A sample risk assessment form can be found in the appendices at the end of this guide. Numerical values are assigned to descriptive phrases relating to: The likelihood of occurrence (LO) The frequency of exposure (FE) The degree of possible harm (OPH) The number of persons at risk (NP) The hazard description is vital in understanding those risk assessments, unless otherwise stated, the risk assessment relates to the hazards in the normal operation of the machine. Where a specific risk is associated with that equipment, a separate risk assessment will be provided. Where there is no control over the frequency of exposure, a worst-case scenario must be assumed, and a constant frequency is assigned.

Anyone involved in a risk assessment project for machinery should refer to this list as matter of course unless they are totally confident in their knowledge and ability to carry out the assessment. Safety Related Control Systems A control system responds to input signals from the machine or from the operator and generates output signals. These make the machine operate in a desired manner. So if for example, an operator presses a start button then the control system may respond by closing a contactor and energising a motor. Control systems can be implemented in a range of technologies, but this guidance is mostly concerned with electro technical systems employing electrical, electronic and programmable electronic technologies. Electro technical control systems can range from simple electromechanical relay based systems to complex programmable systems with multiple analogue and digital inputs and outputs. What is a safety related control system? A control system in a machine should be regarded as being safety-related if it contributes to reducing the occurrence of a hazardous situation or if it is required 2 sectionRisk Assessment 15to function correctly to maintain or achieve safety. The functions carried out by a safety-related control system are termed safety functions. Generally safety functions either prevent the initiation of a hazard or detect the onset of a hazard. Safety-related control systems should be designed and configured to be reliable enough (bearing in mind the consequences of any failure) and to perform the necessary functions to achieve or maintain a safe state or mitigate the consequences of a hazard. To assist a designer or assessor in deciding which of the two main standards to use: BS EN ISO 13849 or EN (IEC) 62061, a distinction is drawn between those electro technical safety related systems that",

They are both harmonised to the Machinery Directive and this has left many people confused about which standard should be applied in any particular application. EN ISO 13849-1 (Safety of machinery, Safety related parts of control systems, General principles for design) is the standard that replaced, EN 954-1 (Safety of machinery, Safety related parts of control systems, General principles for design), EN 954-1 was completely withdrawn at the end of 2011. EN 62061 (Safety of machinery, functional safety of safety-related electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems) is also harmonised to the Machinery Directive. It is a machinery sector standard based on the requirements of IEC 61508.From a users point of view if you are implementing safety related controls using electrical/electronic/programmable electronic systems (E/E/PES) there is no clear distinction as to which of the standards should be used for any particular application (EN ISO 13849-1 is not “technology specific” and can be used as guidance for non-electrical technologies). The choice will be influenced by quite a number of factors, however whichever of the standards you choose the main steps to follow, and the outcomes, are pretty much the same. The Choice In the UK there was a considerable body of opinion that the use of BS EN ISO 13849-1 should be restricted to low complexity safety systems, and that BS EN 62061 should be chosen for systems that used “Safety PLCs”, indeed the national foreword to the original BS editions of the standards almost said as much.

So how does a user make the decision? As already mentioned if the safety-related controls use technologies other than E/E/PES then EN ISO 13849-1 is the only choice, but for the vast majority of systems several factors will influence the choice. It is becoming clear that more use is being made of EN ISO 13849-1, this is probably due to it being the replacement for EN 954-1 and carrying over a lot of the familiar content, but it might also be because it is seen as the more straightforward of the two (not necessarily the case!). Risk Assessment 2 section 16Some considerations that might influence the choice are: Previous knowledge and experience in the design of machinery control systems based upon the concept of Categories described in ISO 13849-1:1999 may mean that the use of ISO 13849-1:2006 is more appropriate; Control systems based upon media other than electrical may mean that the use of ISO 13849-1 is more appropriate; Customer requirements to demonstrate the safety integrity of a machine control system in terms of a Safety Integrity Level (SIL) may mean that the use of IEC 62061 is more appropriate; Control systems of machinery used in, for example, the process industries, where other safety-related systems (such as safety instrumented systems in accordance with IEC 61511) are characterised in terms of SILs may mean that the use of IEC 62061 is more appropriate.(Source ISO/DTR 23849) Main steps Machinery safety starts at the very beginning with the design and development of the machine itself.

It is also worth noting that neither EN ISO 13849-1 nor EN 62061 cover the general electrical safety aspects for machinery, this is the subject of EN 60204. So it is only once it has been decided that further risk reduction is required from safeguards utilising safety related controls that we should consider the guidance given by either EN ISO 13849-1 or EN 62061. Both standards use the concept of “functional safety” which means specifying the safety requirements in terms of the functional requirements (for example: “When the guard is opened hazardous movement must be stopped”), and the amount of risk reduction required. EN 62061 uses Safety Integrity Levels (SIL), EN ISO 13849-1 uses Performance Levels (PL). Both standards require the user to follow essentially the same series of steps: SIL 3 is directly equivalent to PLe, SIL 2 is directly equivalent to PLd, SIL 1 is equivalent to PLb – PLc Verification according to hardware reliability. In order to verify that a target SIL or PL has been achieved it is necessary to consider a number of things, these include the hardware architectures of the safety related controls (e.g. single channel or dual channel), the reliability of the components used, the amount of Diagnostic Coverage (DC), and the susceptibility to Common Cause Failures (CCF). These are considered to be the quantifiable aspects.EN ISO 13849-1 Performance Level (PL)Average probability of a dangerous failure per hour [1/h]EN 62061 Safety Integrity Level (SIL) a ≥ 10-5 to < 10-4no special safety requirements b ≥ 3 x 10-6 to < 10-51 c ≥ 10-6 to < 3 x 10-61 d ≥ 10-7 to < 10-62 e ≥ 10-8 to < 10-73 2 sectionRisk Assessment Assess the Risks Allocate the Safety measures Design Architecture",

In IEC 62061 the requirement is a Safety Integrity Level (SIL), in ISO 13849-1 it is a Performance Level (PL). Both SILs and PLs are defined in terms of the average probability of a dangerous failure per hour, and there is a correspondence between them. The future? The standards organisations are working to produce a single standard that will combine the contents of IEC 62061 and ISO 13849, this standard will be published as IEC/ISO 17305. Publication is not expected until about 2018. Common Hazards These common faults and hazards are examples taken from our experience and are illustrated using the TÜV SÜD virtual reality training model. Isolators Common faults that are found are that there isn’t an isolator fitted, the isolator is of the wrong type or is incorrectly fitted, the mains isn’t terminated at the isolator. Image B is a corrected version of A. Multiple Earths/ terminations Another common electrical fault is that of multiple terminations, in particular with earthing, onto one point. Guarding Guarding is one of the more visual issues for machinery safety. The examples used below are extreme but the issues concerned are, is there guarding on the machine and is it adequate. Hydraulics and Pneumatics Where you find hydraulics and pneumatics on machinery, safety issues include the state of the pipework, whether the pipes are correctly labelled and whether they have lockable isolators or not. 17 Risk Assessment 2 section Take your training to a higher level Make sure you keep up-to-date with the latest machinery safety",

Another item would be the requirement to provide safety guards to machine tools. The requirements are wide ranging, taking into account potential dangers to operators and other persons who may be at risk. The Essential Health and Safety Requirements are mandatory. However, taking into account the state of art, it may not be possible to meet all the objectives set by them. With this in mind, the machinery must be designed and constructed with the purpose of approaching these objectives. Within the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations, the Essential Health and Safety Requirements are divided into six sections: 1. EHSRs applicable to all machinery 2. EHSRs for Certain categories of machinery including Foodstuffs machinery, machinery for cosmetics or pharmaceutical products, hand-held and/or hand-guided machinery, portable fixing and other impact machinery, machinery for working wood and material with similar physical characteristics 3.

EHSRs to offset hazards due to the lifting of moving of persons The 2006/42/EC Directive made changes to a number of the EHSRs. Some of the more significant changes are as follows: EHSR 1.1.7 The operating position must be designed to avoid any risk due to exhaust gases/ lack of oxygen EHSR 1.1.8 work stations that are an integral part of the machine must be designed for the installation of seating EHSR 1.2.2 Manual controls must be clearly visible and identifiable; the use of pictograms is recommended EHSR 1.4.2.1 Fixed guards.",

Iteration of this process can be necessary to eliminate hazards as far as practicable and to adequately reduce risks by the implementation of protective measures.” 20 3 sectionFour steps to CE marking 21To assist manufacturers comply with the Directives and to harmonise standards throughout the EEA the European Commission charged CEN (Commission for European Normalisation) to prepare standards which will provide a European wide scope.

Step 3: Declaration The Declaration of Conformity is a certificate, which must accompany every machine placed on what is termed “the market” (unless a Declaration of Incorporation is issued instead). The manufacturer of a machine automatically places the machine on “the market”. The Declaration is the manufacturer’s assurance to the customer that the product complies with the applicable directives. The Declaration carries relevant product information and is signed by a responsible person on behalf of the manufacturer or importer.Declaration of Incorporation Partly completed machinery means an assembly which is almost machinery but which cannot in itself perform a specific application. It is only intended to be incorporated into or assembled with other machinery or partly completed machinery. The manufacturer of partly completed machinery should draw up a declaration of incorporation which should accompany the assembly instructions and the partly completed machinery when it is placed on the market. The declaration and assembly instructions will then form part of the technical file for the final machinery. Step 4: CE mark Affix the CE mark to machines which are issued with a Declaration of Conformity only.

    "text": "The EMC Directive, 2004/108/EC is due to be superseded by the EMC Directive 2014/30/EU in April 2016. In the UK the Directive is implemented by the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Regulations 2006. The EMC Directive is concerned with the protection of the radio spectrum to ensure that broadcast radio, TV, communication and telecommunication systems can operate without interference. The immunity requirement ensures that equipment operates without unacceptable degradation. What is less well realised is that the EMC Directive is not a safety Directive and does not address EMC and its impact on Functional Safety. The requirement for equipment to remain safe in relation to EMC and Functional Safety falls under the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC itself, specifically under clause 1.5.11; External radiation - Machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way that external radiation does not interfere with its operation. However demonstrating EMC and Functional Safety under the Machinery Directive requires compliance with the EMC Directive as a first step but with the addition of a risk assessment of the design for EMC and Functional Safety and the achievement of higher immunity performance for safety related elements. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is an issue that many machine builders find complex and confusing, but that doesn’t mean that they can ignore their legal obligation to ensure their products meet the requirements of the EMC and Machinery Directive.There can be no doubt about the need for electromagnetic compatibility. If, for example, the control system of a machine is disturbed by electromagnetic interference it may randomly malfunction, creating a potentially dangerous situation. Conversely, if the electrical and electronic systems fitted to a machine generate a high level of interference, they may cause other nearby equipment to malfunction. Higher Immunity The machinery sector Functional Safety standard EN 62061, based on EN 61508, requires higher levels",

EMC immunity testing is one of the verification techniques but as IEC/TS 61000-1-2 states, EMC and Functional Safety cannot be achieved by testing alone due to the difficulty of testing all combinations and permutations of equipment and environment, operating conditions and modes of operation. Conversely testing at higher immunity levels can find failures that could not be predicted by reviewing the design and therefore has a verification role to assess the ‘common’ EMC failure mechanisms. A new draft standard has been issued that provides more specific guidance on the higher immunity levels required; EN 61000-6-7 Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - Part 6-7: Generic standards - Immunity requirements for equipment intended to perform functions in a safety-related system (functional safety) in industrial locations. 4 sectionEMC Solution 27Risk Assessment for EMC and Functional Safety The best practice method of achieving EMC and Functional Safety is by reference to technical specification IEC/TS 61000-1-2; Methodology for the achievement of functional safety of electrical and electronic systems including equipment with regard to electromagnetic phenomena. IEC/TS 61000-1-2 can be considered the ‘EMC annex’ to EN 61508 and EN 62061. Where possible the design should mitigate the EMC immunity hazard by use of e.g. inherently immune technology, diverse technology and other design measures such as those set out in the IET guide; Overview of techniques and measures related to EMC for Functional Safety, available on the IET website. Although the tools available for EMC hazard and risk assessment are limited, approaches are available such as those specified in IEC/TS 61000-1-2 to construct an EMC matrix to identify and analyse the safety related elements of a system and their interaction with internal and external sources of interference.

    "text": "that even if a safety related element becomes susceptible, the overall system remains safe. EMC Directive Returning to the first step to meet the EMC Directive, to understand the implications for machine builders, a good starting point is to look at the “Guide to the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Regulations 2006”. Section 2 of this guide, which covers essential requirements, includes statements that can be summarised as saying that equipment must be designed and manufactured so that the electromagnetic disturbance it creates is not excessive, and so that it has a reasonable level of immunity to electromagnetic disturbances. In addition, fixed installations – which includes the majority of machines - must be installed applying good engineering practices and respecting the intended use of its components. Then comes a very interesting statement, “There are no conformity assessment or CE marking requirements for fixed installations”. Does this mean that builders of machines categorised as fixed installations have no need to concern themselves with the EMC performance of their products? Indeed it does not. The machines must still be designed and manufactured so that they meet the essential requirements mentioned earlier – the only relaxation of the rules relates to assessment and marking, not to performance! But how can machine builders be sure that their products really do have satisfactory EMC performance? It’s very tempting to think that the answer is to use only components that are themselves compliant with the EMC Regulations. Surely, if all of the components used in a machine satisfy the regulations, it’s reasonable to conclude that the whole machine must also meet the regulations? Unfortunately, that’s not how it works and it’s relatively easy to see why. Consider, for example, a variable speed drive that, for the sake of argument, produces a level of electromagnetic interference about half of",

EMC Solution 4 section 28Now put four of those drives on a machine. Is it reasonable to assume that the machine complies with the regulations, simply because each of the drives is compliant? Probably not. The machine may be compliant, especially if measures to control EMC have been incorporated in its design, but the point is that it can’t be assumed to be compliant. In fact, since there is no proven way of calculating or modelling the EMC performance of a machine, it is the opinion of TÜV SÜD that the only way compliance with the EMC Directive can be verified is by testing. This opinion may be considered by some as rather controversial, but when the Health & Safety Executive was asked to comment on this issue, it provided the following statement: “Section 6 of the Health & Safety at Work Act (HSW) places a duty on manufacturers to carry out or arrange for the carrying out of such testing and examination as may be necessary to ensure that the article is so designed and constructed that it will, as far as is reasonably practicable, be safe and without risks to health. In the context of EMC, in most applications it is the electromagnetic immunity of equipment that is of interest in relation to Section 6 of the HSW. If it is reasonably practicable to carry out testing for immunity to electromagnetic disturbances, the HSW requires this to be carried out”. This statement leaves no room for doubt about the necessity for EMC testing of machines in the vast majority of cases – there is simply no shortcut to achieving compliance with the EMC and Machinery Directive Regulations.

    "text": "also no doubt that EMC testing can be complex and time consuming, especially for the majority of machine builders that lack in-house expertise in this specialist area.For this reason, many machine builders find it preferable to work with a specialist consultant like TÜV SÜD on matters relating to EMC. Provided that they are involved with a project at an early enough stage, a consultant of this type can provide design guidance that will help to optimise the EMC performance of the machine, as well as giving invaluable advice on compliance and testing. The consultant’s services may also include arranging for and supervising the tests. The period after testing is often the time when the knowledge and ability of the consultant engineer really comes into play. Rather than walk away from a machine which has issues with EMC and hence has failed some or all of the tests carried out, TÜV SÜD engineers will work with the customer to find the source of the problem and guide the customer to find a solution. The following principles can be used to improve the machines EMC performance and help pass the testing. 1. Mains Filters To reduce the conducted emissions from the machine and improve its immunity to transients, a mains filter is required. It is important to ensure that all supply cables are filtered, i.e. all live supply cables and Neutral. When fitting a mains filter it is important to ensure that it is fitted correctly, i.e. it must be mounted at the point where the mains incoming cable enters the cabinet, the body of the mains filter should be bonded to the metal work of the electrical cabinet and the bond should be metal to metal. When wiring the rest of the electrical cabinet ensure that all cables are routed away",

These can be broken down into the following broad areas: Type 1: Sensitive analogue cables. (Measuring signals) Type 2: Ordinary analogue cables and digital cables. (RS422, RS458, limit switches) Type 3: Low voltage AC controls and DC power. (Relays, contactors, solenoids DOL motors) Type 4: Very noisy signals. (Inverter input / output cables, DC motors, RF generators) It is important not to mix the different types of cable together, however when contact is unavoidable they should run perpendicular to each other. When the machine consists of a number of sub assemblies, which require interconnection via long lengths of cables, it is recommended that where possible, screened cables be used. The screens of these cables must be bonded to their local EMC earth at both ends, and it is recommended that this bonding exists around all 360 degrees of the cables (i.e. their entire periphery).Unscreened cables entering and leaving the cabinet should be filtered. When installing screened cables the screen should not be used as a signal return path. For unscreened cables all signal and return cables should be twisted, i.e. Live & Neutral, 24v and 0v. It is important not to mix signal and return cables. When bonding other parts of machinery such as doors and lids etc. ensure that the earth straps have a large cross section. Braids or thick cables are normally used for these purposes. These should be kept as short as possible.

    "text": "easily overlooked, changes was that the onus was now put on the end-user to make sure that the equipment complies with all relevant legislation such as CE marking. These changes were re-enforced with further changes in June 2002. This point has been further backed up in other guidance from HSE including “INDG 271 - Buying new machinery”. This document asks the question “Is CE marking a guarantee of safety?” The answer given is “No. The manufacturer is claiming that the machinery complies with the law. You still need to check the machine is safe before it is used”. A list of items to think about (such as do any parts look dangerous, are there guards and are they in place?) is included along with a brief checklist entitled “What do I do when I have bought new machinery?” The key in all of this is that the emphasis is on the purchaser to check that the machine is safe to use. If this is the case, and the end-user should now check more thoroughly regarding the CE marking of new equipment, what is the best way to do this? PUWER To fully comply with PUWER, any new equipment should be inspected after installation and before it is put into use to make sure it is safe. This inspection, if carried out correctly, will highlight any safety issues, which may have an effect on the CE marking of the equipment. Any issues that appear to relate to the CE marking of the equipment should be raised with the manufacturer or supplier of the equipment. However, as the equipment has been installed it may be more difficult to deal with. The Solution A solution to this is to use a User Requirement Specification (URS) when purchasing new equipment. This specification will outline",

    "text": "your requirements for the equipment supplier. A URS should include statements such as: The machine must comply with all applicable European and UK legislation. (List all applicable Directives) Euro-Norm Standards should be used to achieve compliance with the Essential Safety Requirements of all applicable Directives Documentary evidence demonstrating compliance with all applicable Directives will be required A Declaration of Conformity will be required A CE mark will be applied to the machine, preferably on the makers nameplate A full operation and maintenance manual that complies with EHSR 1.7.4 of the Machinery Directive will be required The above is not a complete list, but is indicative of the type of information you should be asking for. To ensure compliance with the URS, the equipment may need to be inspected or audited before it is shipped from the manufacturer or supplier. But this inspection need not 6 sectionPre-Purchase Audit 37be limited to only safety issues. Often a purchaser may want to inspect his equipment to ensure the product he is receiving is indeed the product he believes he is buying. These inspections are both engineering and quality based. Often a company may lack the skill or resources to carry out an inspection of this type in one visit. Combining the two inspections into one is a cost effective method of ensuring the machine you receive is both safe and meets your specification. Any potential issues can be raised with the manufacturer and either dealt with before it is shipped or at least be planned into the installation process once the equipment has been shipped. Retrofitting is the more difficult method of compliance; it is always advisable to deal with safety as early as possible in the purchasing process, the design stage being preferable. So, if as a company, you decide to include",

    "text": "such an audit in your equipment purchasing policy, what would you need to look at and who should carry out the audit? Dealing with the person first, they should have a good knowledge of the equipment type itself as well as competent understanding of PUWER and CE marking legislation and have a sound engineering background to understand the latest developments in machine manufacture. Whilst the auditor may not go through the EHSRs as in-depth as the manufacturer, the same areas need to be covered. It may be beneficial for the auditors to create a generic checklist that can be used so that all people who are carrying out an audit for the company are looking at the same points. Areas to look at include: Documentation, manuals, etc. Drawings, electrical pneumatic, hydraulic etc. Electrical wiring and termination checks Hardware checks Environmental checks Calibration, machine parameters, control systems Software Safety CE, PUWER as applicable Safety related control systems, interlocks etc. Safety, manual handling, COSHH, hazards etc Ergonomic Assessments Maintenance and cleaning procedures Training requirements It may also be beneficial at this stage to collate all the relevant documentation such as manuals, drawings etc so that a file is in place when the equipment arrives on site. External Assistance There may be many reasons why a company feels that a pre-purchasing audit is not feasible. It may be manpower, time, competence or a mixture of the three. TÜV SÜD currently carries out this kind of audit for a number of major blue chip companies, both in the UK and abroad. Following the audit, the client will receive a full report highlighting any problem areas with a recommended corrective action. TÜV SÜD can also carry out an inspection to enable compliance with PUWER.Pre-Purchase Audit 6 section 38 38 38 Machinery Safety Training Make sure",
